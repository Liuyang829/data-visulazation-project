Migrating to Australia in 1888, he became a clergyman in Melbourne. In 1901, he attempted to gain Protectionist endorsement to contest the Australian House of Representatives seat of Southern Melbourne; when he was unsuccessful, he turned to the Labor Party, which endorsed him instead. Ronald won the seat, one of only two Victorian Labor members elected in the first federal election. Ronald's seat was abolished in 1906, and he attempted to gain Labor endorsement to contest the neighbouring Melbourne Ports. When this endorsement was given to James Mathews instead, Ronald contested the seat as an independent Labor candidate, but was unsuccessful.

"4450 Pan, provisional designation 1987 SY, is a highly eccentric, contact-binary asteroid, classified as a near-Earth asteroid and potentially hazardous object. It belongs to the group of Apollo asteroids and measures approximately 1.1 kilometers in diameter. It was discovered on 25 September 1987, by American astronomers Eugene and Carolyn Shoemaker at the U.S Palomar Observatory in California. The stony S-type asteroid orbits the Sun at a distance of 0.6–2.3 AU once every 633 days (1 year and 9 months). Its orbit has a high eccentricity of 0.59 and an inclination of 6° with respect to the ecliptic. As an Apollo asteroid, it is an Earth-crosser and has a minimum orbit intersection distance with Earth of 0.0283 AU (4,230,000 km) or 11.0 lunar distances. In addition, due to its extremely eccentric orbit, it is also a Venus- and Mars-crosser and approaches Mercury within 20 Gm. Its first observation was made at Heidelberg Observatory in 1937, yet it remained unused and the asteroid's observation arc begins with its discovery observation in 1987. The asteroid is a contact binary, composed of two lobes in mutual contact, held together only by their weak gravitational attraction, and typically show a dumbbell-like shape (also see 4769 Castalia). A large number of near-Earth objects are thought to be contact binaries. The Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link assumes a standard albedo for stony asteroids of 0.20 and calculates a diameter of 1.1 kilometers, while photometric observations by Italian Albino Carbognani at Saint-Barthelemy Observatory (B04) gave a diameter of 1.0±0.2 kilometers. In September 2013, a rotational light-curve of this asteroid was obtained from photometric observations by U.S. astronomer Brian D. Warner at his Palmer Divide Station in Colorado. It gave a long rotation period of 56.48±0.02 hours with a brightness variation of 0.64 in magnitude (U=3). The well-defined period superseds two previous observations by Petr Pravec at Silvano Casulli that gave a period of 60±12 and 3.51±0.02 hours, respectively.(U=2/1). The minor planet was named after Pan, the Greek god of nature, shepherds of flocks and wild animals. In art, he was represented as a horned half-man, half goat. Pan was worshiped by the citizens of Athens, after he had inspired panic in the hearts of their Persians enemies in the Battle of Marathon (also see 4356 Marathon).

"Saint Saturninus of Cagliari (Italian: San Saturnino, Saturno) is venerated as the patron saint of Cagliari. According to Christian tradition, Saturninus was a local martyr –that is, he was killed at Cagliari by order of governor Barbarus. The legend states that he was beheaded for refusing to offer sacrifices to Jupiter during the persecutions of Christians by Diocletian. However, some scholars have determined that this tradition was invented centuries after the supposed martyrdom, and that the legend was devised a posteriori to attach a story to the name to whom the local ancient basilica was dedicated. But the name of the saint in Sardinian language, \""Santu Sadurru\"" (Saint Saturnus) suggests that there really was the martyrodom of Saturnus, a young Christian by the pagans and the saint was exactly buried where the ancient church was erected. Saint Saturninus was so confused with Saturninus of Toulouse (Sernin). “Saturninus” was the name of several other martyrs, including some belonging to the group of the Martyrs of Abitina, and close trading ties and communications between North Africa and Cagliari may have resulted in the cult of a North African saint becoming attached to this Sardinian location.",Agent,Cleric,Saint,Saturninus_of_Cagliari,193

"The water horsetail (Equisetum fluviatile), also known as the swamp horsetail, is a perennial horsetail that commonly grows in dense colonies along freshwater shorelines or in shallow water, growing in ponds, swamps, ditches, and other sluggish or still waters with mud bottoms. It is a herbaceous species, growing 30–100 cm (rarely 140 cm) tall with erect dark green stems 2–8 mm in diameter, smooth, with about 10–30 fine ridges. At each joint, the stem has a whorl of tiny, black-tipped scale leaves 5–10 mm long. Many, but not all, stems also have whorls of short ascending and spreading branches 1–5 cm long, with the longest branches on the lower middle of the stem. The side branches are slender, dark green, and have 1–8 nodes with a whorl of five scale leaves at each node. The water horsetail has the largest central hollow of the horsetails, with 80% of the stem diameter typically being hollow. The stems readily pull apart at the joints, and both fertile and sterile stems look alike. The water horsetail reproduces both by spores and vegetatively by rhizomes. It primarily reproduces by vegetative means, with the majority of shoots arising from rhizomes. Spores are produced in blunt-tipped cones at the tips of some stems. The spore cones are yellowish-green, 1-2 cm long and 1 cm broad, with numerous scales in dense whorls. The water horsetail ranges throughout the temperate Northern Hemisphere, from Eurasia south to central Spain, northern Italy, the Caucasus, China, Korea and Japan, and in North America from the Aleutian Islands to Newfoundland, south to Oregon, Idaho, northwest Montana, northeast Wyoming, West Virginia and Virginia. This horsetail is sometimes seen as an invasive species because it is very hardy and tends to overwhelm other garden plants unless it is contained. When planting, it is best to plant them with the rhizome in a container.

"The Vegas Valley leopard frog (Lithobates fisheri) is a species of frog previously declared extinct. Once it occurred in the Las Vegas Valley, as well as Tule Springs, Clark County, southern Nevada, United States of America, at elevations between 370 and 760 m (1,210 and 2,490 ft). It was believed to be the only frog endemic to the United States to have become extinct in modern times. A. Vanderhorst collected 10 specimens of this species at Tule Springs on January 13, 1942. These frogs were believed to be the last recorded specimens of the Vegas Valley leopard frog, and are now in the University of Michigan Museum of Comparative Zoology collection. The Vegas Valley leopard frog was considered extinct after extensive searches have failed to locate the species. In 2011, a genetic analysis using DNA from preserved museum specimens of the Vegas Valley leopard frog revealed it is 100% identical, genetically, to the northwestern Mogollon Rim populations of the Chiricahua leopard frog (Lithobates chiricahuensis), which is extant but threatened. While it has been extirpated from the Las Vegas area, the frog is no longer considered extinct because it is the same species as the Chiricahua leopard frog. According to nomenclatural priority, the northwestern Mogollon Rim population of L. chiricahuensis, described in 1979, is referable to the 1893-described, extinct population of the species, L. fisheri. L. chiricahuensis may remain a valid taxon for the southern and eastern range of the Chiricahua leopard frog. It appears then that there are two separate species within the fisheri/chiricahuensis complex - Lithobates fisheri, comprising the former Vegas Valley leopard frogs near Las Vegas and the Chiricahua leopard frogs from the Mogollon Rim, and Lithobates chiricahuensis, comprising the Chiricahua leopard frogs from the southern and eastern portions of the range in Arizona and New Mexico. The status of the Chiricahua leopard frogs in northern Mexico may be uncertain, and this may be yet another separate lineage.

"Mark Stephen Scott (born 10 March 1959 in Muswell Hill, Middlesex) is a former English cricketer who played county cricket for Worcestershire in the early 1980s. Scott appeared on a number of occasions for the Second XIs of Middlesex and Glamorgan between 1977 and 1980 before moving to Worcestershire, for whom he made his first-class debut in June 1981 against Surrey at The Oval. Opening the batting, Scott made 46 and 52, and retained his place for much of the rest of the season thanks to some solid scores including what was to prove his only first-class century, 109 against Gloucestershire in mid-July. He finished the 1981 season with 968 first-class runs at 26.08, including that hundred and six further half-centuries though his one-day form was less impressive as his top score was only 42. Scott began the 1982 season fairly well established in the Worcestershire side, but a succession of low scores saw him play only occasionally from mid-season onwards. In 1983 he forced his way back into the first team, but again did poorly, making a pair against Nottinghamshire in July in what turned out to be his penultimate first-class match (he made 23 and 21 in his last, against Essex in late August). Scott left Worcestershire for Sussex in 1984, and remained for 1985 as well, but never played a first-team game for that county and after a year out of county cricket he returned to New Road in 1987 to begin an unusual final chapter of his Worcestershire career. He never played first-team cricket for the county again, but for six seasons he captained the Second XI, often coming in at the bottom of the order despite his batting ability. Against Hampshire II in 1991 he made 2 from number 11 in the first innings, then when Worcestershire followed on he opened the batting and hit 181! He amassed 61 not outs from 94 innings during these years in the seconds. In 1993 Scott was part of the victorious Old Hill team which beat local rivals West Bromwich Dartmouth in the final of the Abbot Ale National Club Championship at Lord's, and six years later he made one final List A appearance for the Worcestershire Cricket Board XI against Hampshire Cricket Board in the NatWest Trophy. Scott is one of very few Level 4 cricket coaches in the world and is now coaching the Gresham's School First XI cricket team in Holt, a small town in Norfolk, England.

"Kevin Peter Pietersen MBE (born 27 June 1980) is an English professional cricketer. He is a right-handed batsman and occasional off spin bowler who currently plays for Melbourne Stars in the Big Bash League and Quetta Gladiators in the Pakistan Super League. He has also been signed by the Rising Pune Supergiants for the 2016 season of the Indian Premier League. Pietersen was born to an Afrikaner father and English mother in Pietermaritzburg, Natal Province, South Africa. He made his first-class debut for Natal in 1997 before moving to England in 2000, after voicing his displeasure at the racial quota system in South African cricket. Being of English ancestry, Pietersen was eligible for the England team so long as he first served a four-year qualifying period in English county cricket. He was called up by England almost immediately after he completed four years with Nottinghamshire. He made his international debut in the One Day International (ODI) match against Zimbabwe in 2004 and his Test match debut in the 2005 Ashes series against Australia. Pietersen left Nottinghamshire for Hampshire in 2005, but the England team's subsequent reliance on him resulted in Pietersen's making only a single first-class appearance for his new county between 2005 and 2010. In June 2010, Pietersen announced his wish to leave Hampshire; he joined Surrey on loan for the remainder of the season, then moved permanently in 2011. Pietersen was captain of the England Test and ODI teams from 4 August 2008 to 7 January 2009, but resigned after just three Tests and nine ODIs following a dispute with the England coach Peter Moores, who was sacked the same day. Pietersen's relationship with the ECB never fully recovered. This came to a head in 2012 when, after a disagreement over his schedule, Pietersen announced his retirement from all forms of international limited-overs cricket on 31 May. Although he later retracted his retirement, his relationship with both the ECB and his team-mates soured during the series against South Africa, and he was dropped for the final Test of that series. Pietersen last played for England in the 2013–14 Ashes and subsequent ODIs, after which he was informed that he was no longer being considered for international selection.

"The River Wye is a limestone river in the Peak District of Derbyshire, England. It is 15 miles (24 km) in length, and is one of the major tributaries of the River Derwent, which flows into the River Trent, and ultimately into the Humber and the North Sea. The river's source lies just west of Buxton, on Axe Edge Moor. Part of the flow passes underground through Poole's Cavern before rising at Wye Head, and flowing through the Pavilion Gardens in Buxton. It then flows east, along a route roughly followed by the A6 road. It enters the Peak District, flows just south of Tideswell, then through Ashford in the Water and Bakewell, and south of Haddon Hall, before meeting the River Derwent at Rowsley. The main tributary of the river is the River Lathkill, which enters approximately one mile from its mouth. The River Wye is one of Derbyshire's best known rivers and is popular with anglers owing to the large numbers of wild brown, rainbow trout and grayling it contains. The alkalinity of the Wye provides a rich source of nutrients that leads to an abundance of insects, invertebrates and other wildlife. This ensures that the Trout and Grayling grow quickly on a diet of freshwater shrimp, sedge and upwinged flies (to name but a few of the foods available). Some of the largest populations of Water Voles in Britain can also be found along the River Wye. A pleasant walk is possible alongside much of the length of the river, mostly following a former railway line, part of which is now the Monsal Trail and provides some spectacular views of the river. In Monsal Dale the former railway line emerges from a tunnel at Monsal Head, over a viaduct high above the river below. When this structure was built John Ruskin was enraged, and spoke of the Gods being banished by a scheme intended to convey 'every Buxton fool to Bakewell in half an hour' and vice versa, 'and you call this lucrative exchange—you fools everywhere'. It is thus an irony of progress that the railway is now gone and the viaduct is itself a 'listed' structure which is considered to add drama to the dale.",Place,Stream,River,"River_Wye,_Derbyshire",369

She made her first screen appearance during the episode broadcast on 14 May 2013. Terese is portrayed as being ambitious, organised, hard-working and a good mother. Elmaloglou said she admired Terese and that while they shared some similarities, but they did not have much in common. Terese was introduced as the manager of Lassiter's Hotel, which was owned by Paul Robinson (Stefan Dennis). Terese and Paul share a love/hate relationship, but despite the tension between them, they work well together. Terese's other storylines have often revolved around her marriage to Brad Willis (Kip Gamblin) and their family. Terese has struggled to accept that her husband has a daughter with his ex-girlfriend and her friend, Lauren Turner (Kate Kendall). Later storylines have focused on her alcoholism, her subsequent marriage breakdown as Brad left her for Lauren and an attempted assault by Ezra Hanley (Steve Nation).",Agent,FictionalCharacter,SoapCharacter,Terese_Willis,229

September 2014 The road is still practically non-existent for the stretch from Saharanpur to Goripur( Junction of SH 11 connecting to NH 1). Trees are being felled on both sides of the highway hence there are rubbishes periodically on the highway. The potholes are gigantic, road is not lit at night, long stretches of road without any humans in sight and only 3-4 puncture repair centres en route on this road. The road is so infamous that the rowdy, rusty and daring truck/trailer drivers too avaoid this long stretch of road unless absolutely necessary. Hence, if your car/SUV breaks down on the road there's a remote chance that someone will stop to help you out. Mobile network availability is erratic. Villages en route do not have electricity supply too. Strongly advised that hatchback and sedan cars avoid this road. SUVs are in for a thrilling ride on this road and even then the suspension & chasis of the SUV will take a massive beating.

"Lichenomphalia is both a basidiolichen and an agaric genus. Most of the species have inconspicuous lichenized thalli that consist of scattered, small, loose, nearly microscopic green balls or foliose small flakes containing single-celled green algae in the genus Coccomyxa, all interconnected by a loose network of hyphae. The agaric fruit bodies themselves are nonlichenized and resemble other types of omphalinoid mushrooms. These agarics lack clamp connections and do not form hymenial cystidia. The basidiospores are hyaline, smooth, thin-walled, and nonamyloid. Most of the species were originally classified in the genera Omphalina or Gerronema. Historically the species were classified with those other genera in the family, the Tricholomataceae together with the nonlichenized species. Lichenomphalia species can be grouped into brightly colored taxa, with vivid yellow and orange colors, versus the grey brown group, depending upon the microscopic pigmentation deposits. Molecular research comparing DNA sequences now place Lichenomphalia close to the redefined genus Arrhenia, which together with several other genera not traditionally considered to be related, fall within the newly redefined Hygrophoraceae.",Species,Eukaryote,Fungus,Lichenomphalia,170

He led the league in receiving yards in 1978, was elected to the Pro Bowl twice 1978 and 1982, and was named the New York Jets MVP in 1978. Walker was one of the dominant players in the 1982 NFL Playoffs: in two postseason games, he caught 15 passes for 314 yards and 2 touchdowns, as the Jets beat the Cincinnati Bengals and the Los Angeles Raiders, both on the road. His best receiving season came in 1983, when he caught 61 receptions; and in 1986 he had a career-best 12 receiving touchdowns. Four of them were scored in week three, as he caught a game-winning touchdown from the Jets quarterback Ken O'Brien in overtime to give the Jets a wild shootout win 51-45 over the Miami Dolphins. When he retired, he had caught 438 passes for 8306 yards and 71 touchdowns. Walker is now a retired physical education teacher at Park View Elementary School in Kings Park, New York, and an occasional sports radio show commentator. He has two sons and a daughter. His older son, John, was a 3x All-American lacrosse player at The United States Military Academy at West Point. His younger son, Austin, played lacrosse at Johns Hopkins University. He is also the godfather of Alexandra Florant, the daughter of the track and field star Carl Florant.

"The Monte Rosa (or synonymously used as a pleonasm: Monte Rosa massif (Italian: massiccio del Monte Rosa; German: Monte Rosa-Massiv; French: massif du Mont Rose) is a mountain massif located in the eastern part of the Pennine Alps. It is located between Switzerland (Valais) and Italy (Piedmont and Aosta Valley). Monte Rosa is the second highest mountain in the Alps and western Europe. Monte Rosa is a huge ice-covered mountain in the Alps, located on the watershed between northern and southern Europe. Its main summit, named Dufourspitze in honor of the surveyor Guillaume-Henri Dufour, culminates at 4,634 m (15,203 ft) above sea level and is followed by the five nearly equally high subsidiary summits of Dunantspitze, Grenzgipfel, Nordend, Zumsteinspitze and Signalkuppe. Monte Rosa is the highest mountain of both Switzerland and the Pennine Alps and is also the second-highest mountain of the Alps and Europe outside the Caucasus. Monte Rosa covers the region on both side of the border between Switzerland and Italy, although its two main summits, unlike the four lower ones, lies on the Swiss side, within the canton of Valais. On the north-west side of the central Monte Rosa massif, with its enormous ice slopes and seracs, forms the boundary and upper basin of the large Gorner Glacier, which descends towards Zermatt and confluences with its nowadays much larger tributary, the Grenzgletscher (English: Border Glacier), right below the Monte Rosa Hut on the lower end of the visible western wing. The Grenzgletscher forms the impressive glacier between its western wing and Liskamm, a ridge on its southwestern side on the Swiss-Italian border. On the east side, in Italy, the mountain forms an almost vertical 2,400 metres (7,900 ft)-high wall of granite and ice, the biggest in Europe, overlooking Macugnaga and several smaller glaciers. Monte Rosa was studied by pioneering geologists and explorers, including Leonardo da Vinci in the late fifteenth century and Horace-Bénédict de Saussure in the late eighteenth century. Following a long series of attempts beginning in the early nineteenth century, Monte Rosa's summit, then still called Höchste Spitze (English: Highest Peak), was first reached in 1855 from Zermatt by a party of eight climbers led by three guides. The great east wall was first climbed in 1872, from Macugnaga.(See also: History of ascents)\nEach summer a large number of climbers set out from the Monte Rosa Hut on the mountain's west wing for one of its summits via the normal route or for the Margherita Hut on the Signalkuppe (Italian: Punta Gnifetti), used as a research station.

"The Iraq War was a protracted armed conflict that began with the 2003 invasion of Iraq by a United States-led coalition. The invasion regime toppled the government of Saddam Hussein. However, the conflict continued for much of the next decade as an insurgency emerged to oppose the occupying forces and the post-invasion Iraqi government. An estimated 151,000 to 600,000 or more Iraqis were killed in the first 3–4 years of conflict. The United States officially withdrew from the country in 2011 but became re-involved in 2014 at the head of a new coalition; the insurgency and many dimensions of the civil armed conflict continue. The invasion began on 20 March 2003, with the U.S., joined by the United Kingdom and several coalition allies, launching a \""shock and awe\"" bombing campaign. Iraqi forces were quickly overwhelmed as U.S. forces swept through the country. The invasion led to the collapse of the Ba'athist government; Saddam was captured during Operation Red Dawn in December of that same year and executed by a military court three years later. However, the power vacuum following Saddam's demise and the mismanagement of the occupation led to widespread sectarian violence between Shias and Sunnis, as well as a lengthy insurgency against U.S. and coalition forces. The United States responded with a troop surge in 2007 to attempt to reduce the violence. The U.S. began withdrawing its troops in the winter of 2007–08. The winding down of U.S. involvement in Iraq accelerated under President Barack Obama. The U.S. formally withdrew all combat troops from Iraq by December 2011. The Bush administration based its rationale for war principally on the assertion that Iraq possessed weapons of mass destruction (WMDs) and that Saddam's government posed an immediate threat to the United States and its coalition allies. Select U.S. officials accused Saddam of harboring and supporting al-Qaeda, while others cited the desire to end a repressive dictatorship and bring democracy to the people of Iraq. After the invasion, no substantial evidence was found to verify the initial claims about WMDs. The rationale and misrepresentation of pre-war intelligence faced heavy criticism within the U.S. and internationally. In the aftermath of the invasion, Iraq held multi-party elections in 2005. Nouri al-Maliki became Prime Minister in 2006 and remained in office until 2014. The al-Maliki government enacted policies that were widely seen as having the effect of alienating the country's Sunni minority and worsening sectarian tensions. In the summer of 2014, the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL) launched a military offensive in Northern Iraq and declared a worldwide Islamic caliphate, eliciting another military response from the United States and its allies. The Iraq War caused hundreds of thousands of civilian, and thousands of military casualties (see estimates below). The majority of casualties occurred as a result of the insurgency and civil conflicts between 2004 and 2007.",Event,SocietalEvent,MilitaryConflict,Iraq_War,474

Rhythm Tengoku's gameplay focuses on audio cues rather than visual cues to convey information to players. It features a number of unique stages which have their own type of rhythm and gameplay. Players follow the rhythm (in some rhythm games as a character) until the end where they are given a score based on their performance.

"The Saint-Maurice River flows North to South in central Quebec from Gouin Reservoir to empty into the Saint Lawrence River at Trois-Rivières, in province of Quebec, in Canada. From its source at Gouin Reservoir, located at the same latitude as the Lac Saint-Jean, the river has a total drop of about 405 meters, to finally reach the river Trois-Rivières. The river is 563 km in length and has a drainage basin of 43,300 km² (16,700 mile²). Saint-Maurice river is one of the most important tributaries of St. Lawrence river. The main tributaries of the Saint-Maurice River are: \n*  Matawin River, whose mouth is at Matawin (Hamlet); \n*  Vermillon River (La Tuque) which empties about 23 km (by water) upstream (north) of the Beaumont generating station in La Tuque; \n*  Manouane River (La Tuque) which empties about 115 km (by water) upstream (north) of La Tuque; \n*  La Trenche River (La Tuque) which empties near the La Trenche Generating Station; \n*  Croche River (La Tuque) which empties at north of La Tuque.

For much of the 20th century, the river was used to transport logs to mills down river and it was, and still is, a major source of hydroelectric power. First communication channel in this region, the river was used by local Native Americans long before the arrival of Europeans on the spot. Early explorations by religious conversion in pain and trappers in search of furs for the trade, it was one of the primary routes of rivers in Quebec.

"(Main article: Battle of the Somme) High Wood is a wood near Bazentin le Petit in the Somme département of northern France. After the big British attack on 14 July 1916 (the Battle of Bazentin Ridge), High Wood lay undefended for most of the day but delays in communication and confusion caused by orders and counter-orders from different British corps headquarters with overlapping responsibilities, led to the occupation of High Wood being forestalled by German reserves, which had moved forward to counter-attack British troops in the villages of Bazentin-le-Grand and Bazentin-le-Petit. Men from the 7th Division managed to occupy the southern half of the wood and two cavalry squadrons advanced on the east side to Wood Lane, which connected the wood to Longueval. On 15 July, the wood was evacuated by the survivors and the cavalry retired. The British Fourth Army and the German 2nd Army and 1st Army fought for control of the wood from 14 July – 15 September, during the Battle of the Somme. Both sides had many casualties and chronic communication problems; inclement weather grounded aircraft, obscured the view and slowed movement on the roads, which had been severely bombarded and turned to mud as soon as it rained. Trenches and shell holes filled with water, which made infantry movement exceedingly difficult and exhausted trench garrisons. The British and French found it impossible to arrange co-ordinated attacks and fought many small piecemeal actions, rather than general attacks until 15 September. British-French co-operation broke down again and the French did not attack on 15 September, when the British captured the wood during the Battle of Flers–Courcelette (15–22 September). The German defenders had great difficulty finding fresh troops for the Somme front, despite ending the Battle of Verdun (21 February – 20 December) and had to send divisions to the Eastern Front and to Rumania after it declared war on 27 August. Turnover of German divisions was high and many had to be withdrawn and replaced after fourteen days in the front line.

"The Battle of Tsushima (Russian: Цусимское сражение, Tsusimskoye srazheniye), also known as the Battle of Tsushima Strait and the Naval Battle of the Sea of Japan (Japanese: 日本海海戦, Nihonkai-Kaisen) in Japan, was a major naval battle fought between Russia and Japan during the Russo-Japanese War. It was naval history's only decisive sea battle fought by modern steel battleship fleets, and the first naval battle in which wireless telegraphy (radio) played a critically important role. It has been characterized as the \""dying echo of the old era – for the last time in the history of naval warfare ships of the line of a beaten fleet surrendered on the high seas.\"" It was fought on 27–28 May 1905 (14–15 May in the Julian calendar then in use in Russia) in the Tsushima Strait between Korea and southern Japan. In this battle the Japanese fleet under Admiral Tōgō Heihachirō destroyed two-thirds of the Russian fleet, under Admiral Zinovy Rozhestvensky, which had traveled over 18,000 nautical miles (33,000 km) to reach the Far East. In London in 1906, Sir George Sydenham Clarke wrote, \""The battle of Tsu-shima is by far the greatest and the most important naval event since Trafalgar\""; decades later, historian Edmund Morris agreed with this judgment. The destruction of the Russian navy caused a bitter reaction from the Russian public, which induced a peace treaty in September 1905 without any further battles. Prior to the Russo-Japanese War, countries constructed their battleships with mixed batteries of mainly 152 mm (6-inch), 203 mm (8-inch), 254 mm (10-inch) and 305 mm (12-inch) guns, with the intent that these battleships fight on the battle line in a close-quarter, decisive fleet action. The Battle of Tsushima conclusively demonstrated that battleship speed and big guns with longer ranges were more advantageous in naval battles than mixed batteries of different sizes. The wireless telegraph had been invented during the last half of the 1890s, and by the turn of the century nearly all major navies were adopting this improved communications technology. Nonetheless Tsushima would be \""the first major sea battle in which wireless played any role whatsoever.\"" Alexander Stepanovich Popov of the Naval Warfare Institute had built and demonstrated a wireless telegraphy set in 1900, and equipment from the firm Telefunken in Germany was adopted by the Imperial Russian Navy.

"Thomas Codrington (1829, Wroughton, Wiltshire - 1918) was a British engineer and antiquarian of the late Victorian era. With a career background as an Inspector for local government, he published several known works. First was Report on the Destruction of Town Refuse, published by Her Majesty's Stationery Office in 1888. This was only a short pamphlet of 48 pages, including illustrations of furnaces in use at the time. Codrington went on to write the slightly more substantial 172 page work The Maintenance of Macadamised Roads in 1879, published by E. & F.N. Spon. However, by far Codrington's most famous work was also one of his last. Roman roads in Britain, published originally in 1903, was the first attempt by any author to catalogue fully the evident remains of the Roman transport network in the United Kingdom.

"Dorothy Johnstone (1892–1980) was a Scottish painter and watercolourist. Johnstone was born in Edinburgh in 1892 and grew up in Napier Road, near the Gothic Mansion, Rockville. Her father, landscape artist George Whitton Johnstone RSA (1849–1901), encouraged her artistic talents, and at the age of 16 she enrolled as a student at the Edinburgh College of Art. She took the Life Class with Ernest Stephen Lumsden where she revealed her talents at informal portraiture, a genre for which she became well known. In 1914 she became a member of staff at the Edinburgh College of Art. From the summer of 1915, she became a regular annual visitor to Kirkcudbright in Galloway, where she would paint with other mainly female artists including Jessie M. King as part of the Kirkcudbright School. Dorothy Johnstone, with her close friends Cecile Walton and Mary Newbery, was a member of The Edinburgh School, which reformed in 1919, a collective of gifted and progressive artists associated with the Edinburgh College of Art. In 1924, at the peak of her artistic career, Johnstone mounted a joint exhibition in Edinburgh with fellow artist Cecile Walton. She married her colleague and fellow group member David Macbeth Sutherland in 1924. They had a son in 1925 Sir Iain Sutherland (diplomat), and a daughter in 1928. As a consequence of her husband's appointment in 1933 as head of Gray's School of Art in Aberdeen (now at Robert Gordon's University) and of the marriage bar in place at the time, she gave up her career and her students. She kept her links with Edinburgh by continuing to exhibit her portraits and landscapes at the Royal Scottish Academy, to which was elected an Associate (ARSA) in 1962. Johnstone painted landscapes and portraits, particularly of children, and her style was free and relaxed, whether using oil, watercolour, pencil or chalk. Some of her work is displayed at the National Gallery of Scotland. When she died in 1980, she bequeathed her important early painting 'Marguerites' (painted in 1912) to the Royal Scottish Academy.",Agent,Artist,Painter,Dorothy_Johnstone,338

"Lionel Andrés \""Leo\"" Messi (Spanish pronunciation: [ljoˈnel anˈdɾes ˈmesi] ; born 24 June 1987) is an Argentine professional footballer who plays as a forward for Spanish club FC Barcelona and the Argentina national team. Often considered the best player in the world and rated by many in the sport as the greatest of all time, Messi is the only football player in history to win five FIFA Ballons d'Or, four of which he won consecutively, and the first player to win three European Golden Shoes. With Barcelona he has won eight La Liga titles and four UEFA Champions League titles, as well as four Copas del Rey. Both a prolific goalscorer and a creative playmaker, Messi holds the records for most goals scored in La Liga, a La Liga season (50), a football season (82), and a calendar year (91), as well as those for most assists made in La Liga and the Copa América. He has scored over 500 senior career goals for club and country. Born and raised in central Argentina, Messi was diagnosed with a growth hormone deficiency as a child. At age 13, he relocated to Spain to join Barcelona, who agreed to pay for his medical treatment. After a fast progression through Barcelona's youth academy, Messi made his competitive debut aged 17 in October 2004. Despite being injury-prone during his early career, he established himself as an integral player for the club within the next three years, finishing 2007 as a finalist for both the Ballon d'Or and FIFA World Player of the Year award, a feat he repeated the following year. His first uninterrupted campaign came in the 2008–09 season, during which he helped Barcelona achieve the first treble in Spanish football. At 22 years old, Messi won the Ballon d'Or and FIFA World Player of the Year award by record voting margins. Three successful seasons followed, with Messi winning three consecutive FIFA Ballons d'Or, including an unprecedented fourth. His personal best campaign to date was the 2011–12 season, in which he set the La Liga and European records for most goals scored in a single season, while establishing himself as Barcelona's all-time top scorer in official competitions in March 2012. He again struggled with injury during the following two seasons, twice finishing second for the Ballon d'Or behind Cristiano Ronaldo, his perceived career rival. Messi regained his best form during the 2014–15 campaign, breaking the all-time goalscoring records in both La Liga and the Champions League in November 2014, and led Barcelona to a historic second treble. He is currently the second best goalscorer in the history of the European Cup/Champions League. An Argentine international, Messi is his country's all-time leading goalscorer. At youth level, he won the 2005 FIFA World Youth Championship, finishing the tournament with both the Golden Ball and Golden Shoe, and an Olympic gold medal at the 2008 Summer Olympics. His style of play as a diminutive, left-footed dribbler drew comparisons with compatriot Diego Maradona, who declared the teenager his successor. After making his senior debut in August 2005, Messi became the youngest Argentine to play and score in a FIFA World Cup during the 2006 edition, and reached the final of the 2007 Copa América, where he was named young player of the tournament. As the squad's captain from August 2011, he led Argentina to three consecutive finals of the 2014 World Cup, for which he won the Golden Ball, and the 2015 and 2016 Copas América.

"The idea for a Tradesmen's Tideway Head Race for fours, was first mooted in the early 1950s by the Thames Amateur Rowing Association (the TARA). On picking a date for the new race the TARA dropped their plans after learning that the Tradesmen's Rowing Clubs Association had also started to organise a similar open fours race. Thus the fledging \""Head of the River 4's\"" was first raced in 1955. In the following years the race was known as the Tradesmen's Rowing Club's Association Head of the River Fours, though even at this stage ARA clubs were entering along with NARA and TRCA clubs. In the late 1950s the ARA and NARA finally merged into the Amateur Rowing Association of Great Britain. The event then became known simply as the Head of the River Fours, and was handed over to a new Committee in 1963 after the TRCA's eventual amalgamation. Since that time many changes have taken place to the race, including the course length and alterations. Most crew/boat categories with four rowers have been added. In particular the introduction of quads was in 1969 attracting initially the lowest number of entries in a boat class, three. A women's junior quadruple sculls event was added in 2005, in 2007, Women's Elite Coxed Fours were scrapped to be replaced with Women's Senior 2 Coxless Fours and the 2008 race added Elite Open Lightweight and Elite Women's Lightweight quads for the first time. In the first race, 34 crews rowed over a three-mile course from Chiswick Steps to Putney Pier. The entry has grown steadily over the years and in 1990 the race was extended to the full four and a quarter mile Championship Course from Mortlake to Putney (i.e., the Oxford and Cambridge Boat Race course in reverse). For many years the entry exceeded the 500 permitted maximum, but in 1997 the Port of London Authority agreed to a request for 50 more crews.

He was the son of Gilbert, Count of the Maasgau, and a daughter of Lothair I of whom the name is not known (Hiltrude, Bertha, Irmgard, and Gisela are good candidates). He succeeded his father in the Maasgau and was the lay abbot of Echternach between 897 and 915, of Maastricht from before May 898, and of Stablo and Malmedy between 900 and 902. He was the Count of Mons and Count of Liège when in 870 he and Franco, Bishop of Liège, led an army against the Vikings in Walacria. He, as Duke of Hesbaye and Hainault, and Radbold led a Frisian army against the forces of Rollo a little later, but were forced back to his fortresses. In the 877 Capitulary of Quierzy, he appears alongside his father as one of the regents of the kingdom during Charles the Bald's absence on campaign in Italy. A Reginar appears at the Siege of Paris in 886, but this may be an uncle or nephew. The name \""Reginar\"" or \""Reginhar\"" (French: Régnier or Rainier) was commonplace in his family. Reginar was originally a supporter of Zwentibold in 895, but he broke with the king in 898. He and some other magnates who had been key to Zwentibold's election three years earlier then took the opportunity provided by the death of Odo of West Francia to invite Charles the Simple to become king in Lotharingia. His lands were confiscated, but he refused to give them up and entrenched himself at Durfost, downstream from Maastricht. Representatives of Charles, Zwentibold, and the Emperor Arnulf met at Sankt Goar and determined that the succession should go to Louis the Child. Zwentibold was killed by Reginar in battle in August 900. At first, Louis appeared to be opposed to Reginar when he appointed Gebhard as his deputy in Lotharingia, but the two were never at war. In 908, Reginar recuperated the Hainault after the death of Sigard. Then, after the death of Gebhard in 910, in battle with the Magyars, Reginar appears as his successor. He led the magnates in opposing Conrad I of Germany and electing Charles the Simple their king. He was given the title marchio by Charles in 915. He never appears as the Duke of Lorraine, but he was definitely the military commander of the region under Charles.

In Week 16 of the 2010 season, the team clinched the NFL's worst record of that year and was given the #1 pick in the 2011 NFL Draft, with which the team selected Auburn quarterback Cam Newton, the 2010 Heisman Trophy winner. They improved on their 2–14 record from 2010, and finished 6–10, missing the playoffs for the third year in a row. Despite their losing record, Carolina made many improvements. According to Football Outsiders, the Panthers had the biggest year-to-year offensive improvement in their history: they were dead last in 2010, and moved up to 4th offensively in 2011, according to Football Outsiders' statistical formulas. In addition, Football Outsiders states that Carolina had the best running game in their calculations' history. This was due to the addition of Cam Newton's running ability to the high-quality running tandem of running backs DeAngelo Williams and Jonathan Stewart. The rushing attack eclipsed that of the previous record holder, the 2000 St. Louis Rams. In the process, Carolina became the first team in NFL history to have three players with 700 or more yards rushing in the same season: Williams with 836 yards, Stewart with 761 yards, and Newton with 706 yards.

"The Peltoperlidae, also known as roach-like stoneflies or roachflies, are a family of stoneflies. The family Peltoperlidae comprises 11 genera and 46 known species. Species are semivoltine, meaning their lifecycles last 1 to 2 years. Adults of the family usually emerge in late spring or early summer, April through June. Larvae are flattened and brown in color, and they are roach-like in appearance because of the expanded thoracic plates covering the bases of their legs, heads, and abdomens. Tapering gills occur on the thorax at the bases of the legs. These tracheal gills are multifunctional and key to many biological processes. No dense tufts or branching gills are found on their thoraces or abdomens, unlike other Plecoptera families. The larvae also possess broad, chisel-like mandibles. Adults have two ocelli in addition to its two compound eyes. Male epiprocts are sclerotized and rod-like in shape, and both genders lack cross-veins in the anal lobe of the forewings. Peltoperlidae are generally lotic erosional and depositional. These habitats are flowing streams marked by sediments, vascular plants, and detritus. Roach-like stoneflies are generally found in leaf litter and debris piles trapped in either riffles or pools. This family is considered to be clingers-sprawlers; they attach to surface in erosional habitats or rest loosely on the top surfaces of substrates, respectively. The body of this stonefly is flattened and streamlined to aid in minimizing water resistance in a flowing stream. The Peltoperlidae are classified as in the feeding group shredders-detritivores. They chew and mine through leaf litter in their habitats. They are a significant contributor to leaf breakdown in streams. This family is very sensitive to disturbances in environmental conditions. They are intolerant to loss of coarse particulate organic matter for food and habitat. Given this low tolerance, Peltoperlids make potential bioindicators.",Species,Animal,Insect,Peltoperlidae,297

"Michael Robert Sirotka (born May 13, 1971, in Houston, Texas) is a former Major League Baseball left-handed pitcher. He is an alumnus of Louisiana State University. Drafted by the Chicago White Sox in the 15th round of the 1993 Major League Baseball Draft, Sirotka made his major league debut in 1995, pitching in 6 starts that season. The 1996 and 1997 seasons saw Sirotka appear in only 22 games combined between both seasons. After impressing in spring training, Sirotka opened the 1998 season in the White Sox rotation. Sirotka went on to pitch in 33 starts, pitching 5 complete games and recording a win loss record of 14-15 in 211 and 2/3 innings. In 1999, Sirotka lowered his ERA one run lower than the previous season, finishing at an even 4.00. He pitched 3 complete games to go along with a record of 11-13 in 32 starts. The 2000 season saw Sirotka have a breakout year. He had a career high 15 wins with a career low 3.79 ERA for the White Sox, and made his first postseason appearance for the team in the 2000 American League Division Series, starting a game against the Seattle Mariners. In the offseason he traveled to Japan as part of the 2000 MLB Japan All-Star Series and pitched for the MLB squad. On January 14, 2001, he was traded to the Toronto Blue Jays with Kevin Beirne and Brian Simmons for Matt DeWitt and David Wells in a deal that would infamously become labeled by White Sox General Manager Kenny Williams as \""Shouldergate\"", as Sirotka would never pitch again, labeled \""damaged goods\"" by then-Toronto GM Gord Ash. Ash believed that Williams did not turn over all information pertaining to Sirotka's shoulder. Ash later appealed the trade to MLB Commissioner Bud Selig, but Selig refused to overturn the trade. Sirotka underwent major reconstructive shoulder surgery in April 2001 and an arthroscopic procedure in July 2002 in an attempt to get off the disabled list, but neither surgery was successful. The Blue Jays released him after the 2002 season. In October 2002, Sirotka signed a minor league contract with the Chicago Cubs and was invited to spring training. If he made the Cubs' 25-man major league roster on Opening Day, his contract allowed him to make as much as $4 million with incentives. At the time of the signing, Sirotka attributed his \""Shouldergate\"" injuries to pitching with a hurt elbow late in 2000 for the Sox, followed by pitching six innings in Japan that extended the damage into his shoulder. When shoulder problems persisted during the spring, the Cubs sent Sirotka to minor-league camp on March 26, 2003. While with the White Sox, Sirotka surrendered the sole career hit to country music superstar Garth Brooks, who at the time was participating in spring training with the San Diego Padres.

"Lake Ülemiste (Estonian: Ülemiste järv) is the largest of the lakes surrounding Tallinn, Estonia. Ülemiste is the main part of the Tallinn water supply system, where most of the city gets its drinking water from. The lake is fed mostly by Kurna stream and Pirita River (through Vaskjala–Ülemiste canal). Lennart Meri Tallinn Airport is located on the eastern shore of the lake and aircraft regularly take off and land over the lake. The airport maintains the necessary equipment ready to tow out in a short time any aircraft that crashes into the lake, as required by ICAO regulations. The Tallinn Water Company, AS Tallinna Vesi, has a treatment plant on the North shore of the lake which supplies 90% of the water to the city. The remaining 10% comes from ground water wells which, whilst are not necessary as the lake can supply the entire city, are nevertheless maintained as a backup in case the lake ever became contaminated. Such a risk is not trivial considering the proximity of Tallinn Airport to the lake.

This genus contains three species, and are part of the Anomalopteryginae or lesser moa subfamily. Pachyornis moa were the stoutest and most heavy-legged genus of the family. The most notable species being Pachyornis elephantopus - the Heavy-Footed Moa. They were generally similar to the Eastern Moa or the Broad-billed moa of the genus Euryapteryx, but differed in having a pointed bill and being more heavyset in general. At least one species (P. australis) is assumed to have had a crest of long feathers on its head. The species became rapidly extinct following human colonization of New Zealand, with the possible exception of P. australis, which may have already been extinct by then. 1.  \n* REDIRECT  \n* From a page move: This is a redirect from a page that has been moved (renamed).

According to legend, Eudokia asked him if she, too, could be saved from Judgment. Germanos instructed her to remain alone in her chamber for one week, fasting and praying. Eudokia followed his instructions, and at the end of the week, she had a vision about the Archangel Michael that assured her of Christ's love for all people. Germanos later baptized her. At age 30, Eudokia commissioned the building of a monastery near Heliopolis, and dispensed much of her wealth in various charitable projects. She rejected all of her suitors, and when one persistent suitor named Philostratos was struck down because of his persistence, Eudokia prayed for him until he recovered.

"Rio Grande (Portuguese for \""great river\"") is a river in south-central Brazil. It rises in the Mantiqueira Mountains in the state of Minas Gerais and descends inland, west-northwestward. Its lower course marks a portion of the Minas Gerais-São Paulo border. At the Mato Grosso do Sul state border, after a course of 1,090 km (677 mi), it joins the Paranaíba River to form the Upper Paraná River. Major tributaries of the Rio Grande are: \n*  Rio Aiuruoca, whose source is in Itamonte; \n*  Rio das Mortes, whose source lies between Barbacena and Nossa Senhora dos Remédios, Piauí; \n*  Rio Jacaré, whose source is in the Serra do Galba; \n*  Rio Sapucaí, whose source is in the Mantiqueira Mountains in São Paulo; \n*  Rio Pardo, whose source is in Ipuiúna. The basin of the Rio Grande belongs to the Paraná River basin. It has a total area of 143,000 km2 (55,213 sq mi), of which 86,500 km2 (33,398 sq mi) are located within Minas Gerais, which is equivalent to 17.8% of the state territory. The basin of the Rio Grande is responsible for about 67% of all energy generated in the state. The Grande is interrupted by several dams and reservoirs; in the upper Grande the river forms Furnas Dam, then Peixotos Dam, and downstream, Luiz Barreto Dam, Jaguara Dam, Volta Grande Dam, Marimbondo Dam and Água Vermelha Dam. The river plays a major role in production of electricity and, due to rapids and waterfalls, and absence of locks, is only navigable by small craft in limited stretches. However the Estrada de Ferro Oeste de Minas (a narrow gauge railway) operated a passenger and freight steam navigation service between 1889 and 1963. The EFOM met the Rio Grande at Ribeirão Vermelho, from where the service ran down the river for 208 km (129 mi), as far as Capetina. There were six stations on the river between Ribeirão Vermelho and Capetinga, and the railway operated a fleet of 6 stern-wheel paddle steamers, together with barges and launches.

The later Review (as it was called by its contemporaries) featured heavy use of photographic illustration on glossy paper and mixed news of the contemporary labor movement with its typical theoretical fare. Loyal to the Socialist Party of America throughout the entire course of its existence, the International Socialist Review after 1908 was recognized as one of the primary voices of the party's left wing. It defended the concept of revolutionary socialism against those who would reduce the Socialist Party to a party of ameliorative reform, expounded upon the syndicalist ideas of the revolutionary industrial union known as the Industrial Workers of the World, consistently fought against the expansion of militarism being pushed forward by the so-called \""Preparedness\"" movement, and provided a vehicle for the leaders of the Zimmerwald Left to relay their ideas to an American audience. After American intervention in the European World War in 1917, the International Socialist Review came under increasing pressure from the U.S. Post Office Department and United States Department of Justice. Its loss of mailing privileges at the hands of the Wilson administration's Postmaster General, Albert S. Burleson in 1917 sounded the death knell for the publication. The magazine died early in 1918, chiefly due to this government pressure. A brief attempt to revive the publication as The Labor Scrapbook under the editorship of Mary Marcy, Kerr's chief lieutenant, proved unsuccessful in 1918.",Work,PeriodicalLiterature,Magazine,International_Socialist_Review_(1900),292

"The arapaima, pirarucu, or paiche are any large species of bonytongue in the genus Arapaima native to the Amazon and Essequibo basins of South America. Genus Arapaima is the type genus of the family Arapaimidae. They are among the world's largest freshwater fish, reaching as much as 3 m (9.8 ft). They are an important food fish. They have declined in the native range due to overfishing and habitat loss. In contrast, arapaima have been introduced to several tropical regions outside the native range (within South America and elsewhere) where they are sometimes considered invasive species. Its local name, pirarucu, derives from the indigenous words for \""pira\"" meaning \""fish\"" and \""urucum\"" meaning \""red\"". Arapaima was traditionally regarded as a monotypic genus, but later several species were distinguished. As a consequence of this taxonomic confusion, most earlier studies were done using the name A. gigas, but this species is only known from old museum specimens and the exact native range is unclear. The regularly seen and studied species is A. arapaima, although a small number of A. leptosoma also have been recorded in the aquarium trade. The remaining species are virtually unknown: A. agassizii from old detailed drawings (the type specimen itself was lost during World War II bombings) and A. mapae from the type specimen.

Opened in 1998 by sculptor Myrna Orsini as \""a gift to the community,\"" the 80-acre (32 ha) park features sculpture gardens as well as indoor art galleries. In 1992, after visiting art symposia in Europe, founder Myrna Orsini and her business partner Doris Coonrod purchased land for the park. In 1998, the park opened with a rock-carving symposium, which was attended by 13 artists who came from nine countries, including Lithuania, Austria, Cuba, Italy, and Canada; each artist donated a piece to the park's collection. By 2009, Monarch had established a permanent collection of 28 works, many of which were donated by their creators, and also featured 87 other works on consignment. The park exhibits the work of artists from around the world. Local contributors include Valentine Welman, Justin Hahn, and Tom Yody, and owner Myrna Orsini herself; international artists such as Urs Twellmann and Doug Neil have also displayed their work at the park. In the past the park hosted workshops and classes promoting art creation. It also hosted open houses called \""Art in the Park,\"" which are biennial exhibitions where local artists display and sell their work; these events feature live music, dancing, and art. There are several distinct areas within the park, including a fantasy garden, a butterfly garden, a maze, and an interactive sound-sculpture area, set in the partially forested countryside. The park also has hosted visiting artists like Pat Warner. In the summer of 2011, the nonprofit park was set to close due to health and financial concerns, and the property was placed for sale.

"Clarence Victor \""Clarrie\"" Grimmett (25 December 1891 – 2 May 1980) was a cricketer; although born in New Zealand, he played most of his cricket in Australia. He is thought by many to be one of the finest early spin bowlers, and usually credited as the developer of the flipper. Grimmett was born in Dunedin, New Zealand, on Christmas Day, leading Bill O'Reilly to say that he \""must have been the best Christmas present Australia ever received from that country.\"" A schoolmaster encouraged him to concentrate on spin bowling rather than fast bowling. He played club cricket in Wellington, and made his first-class debut for Wellington at the age of 17. At that time, New Zealand was not a Test cricketing nation, and in 1914 he moved to neighbouring Australia, then as now one of the sport's superpowers. He played club cricket in Sydney for 3 years. After marrying a Victorian, he moved to Melbourne, where he played first-class cricket for Victoria. He moved to South Australia in 1923, but it is for his performances in Test cricket for the Australian cricket team that he is best remembered. Grimmett played 37 Tests between 1924 and 1936, taking 216 wickets at an average of just 24.21 runs apiece. He took two five wicket hauls on debut against England in Sydney in 1925. He became the first bowler to reach the milestone of taking 200 Test wickets, and is one of only four Test bowlers that played in their first Test after the age of thirty to take more than 100 wickets, the other three being Dilip Doshi, Saeed Ajmal and Ryan Harris. He took an average of six wickets per match. Many wickets in the last four years of his Test career were taken bowling in tandem with fellow leg-spinner Bill O'Reilly. Grimmett remains the one of the few bowlers with career figures of over 200 wickets in fewer than 40 Tests. He took a five-wicket 'bag' on 21 occasions, seven times finishing with ten wickets or more in a match. His Test career only began when he was aged 33, and ended when he was 44, playing his last Test against South Africa in Durban. Despite taking 44 wickets in the series, and continued success in first-class cricket, he was dropped for the 1936/7 series at home against England, replaced by Frank Ward, and did not join the 1938 tour to England. His first-class records holds a total of 1,424 wickets in 248 matches between 1911 and 1941, again at a rate close to six wickets per match. This total included 5 wicket bags on over 120 occasions and - in one performance for a touring Australian side against Yorkshire in 1930, he took 10 wickets for 37 runs off 22.3 overs, one of only a very small number of players to have claimed all of the wickets in an innings. He took 513 wickets in his 79 Sheffield Shield matches. Grimmett was a Wisden Cricketer of the Year in 1931, the same year as Donald Bradman. He died in Adelaide in 1980, but was posthumously inducted into the Australian Cricket Hall of Fame in 1996 as one of the ten inaugural members.

"The Azad Kashmir Regiment is one of the six infantry regiments of the Pakistan Army. Its Regimental Centre is located at Mansar, Attock District, Punjab. The Azad Kashmir Regular Forces, established in 1947, were armed and supported by the Pakistani government. The regiment has the distinction of not having been raised by any government order, but \""raised itself\"" when bands of armed WWII veterans organized themselves into disciplined ad hoc platoons, companies and battalions led by retired officers, JCOs and NCOs, and went out to fight in Kashmir against the Regular Indian Army in 1948. After a cease-fire was declared in Kashmir, these elements joined together to form the Azad Kashmir Regular Forces (AKRF). The AKRF had its own intake and training structure separate from the Pakistan Army. The AKRF was the military element of the Azad Kashmir Government. Uniforms and rank structures were the same as in the Pakistan Army. At that time, all the battalions of the AKRF were part of the 12th Infantry Division of the Pakistan Army, permanently stationed in Azad Kashmir. Previous Colonel Commandants of the regiment have included Major General Sardar Muhammad Anwar Khan, the former President of Azad Kashmir and Lieutenant General Javed Hassan, who as a major general commanded the Force Command Northern Areas (FCNA) during the 1999 Kargil War and later served as the commander XXX Corps, Gujranwala. As of 2007 the Colonel Commandant was Major General Mukhtar Ahmed. In wartime operations, the AKRF was part of the Order of Battle of the Pakistan Army, in which it was involved in 1965 Operation Gibraltar. All of the AKRF battalions were part of the 12th Infantry Division (Pakistan) that carried out Operation Gibraltar as well as defended Azad Kashmir. During the same operation one of the Company Commanders of 21 Azad Kashmir Regiment, Major Malik Munawar Khan Awan, became famous for his heroic action and occupation of Indian Garrison of Rajauri while commanding Ghaznavi Force during Operation Gibraltar. Later Major Munawar was awarded \""Sitara e Jurat\"" for gallantry and the title of \""King of Rajouri\"" by President Field Marshal Muhammad Ayub Khan. The Azad Kashmir Regular Forces fought in the 1971 war and then in 1972 when the 9th Azad Kashmir Battalion defended Chakpatra and Leepa Valley against a larger Indian force composed of several regular battalions. This particular battalion was first led in 1948 by Lt. Colonel Ghulam Rasul Raja-Sitara-e-Jurrat (1948), Military Cross (WWII) of Sarai Alamgir, and is associated with its leader. During the Battle of Leepa Valley the 9th AK Battalion with 25 Mountain Regiment Artillery distinguished itself under the leadership of Lt. Colonel Haq Nawaz Kyani, SJ and Bar, who died leading the battalion from the front. The Company Commander of B Coy called for artillery fire upon their own position while being over run by the enemy; in doing this they repulsed the enemy attack. The Pakistan Army later honoured the AKRF by absorbing it into its own ranks and by giving it the status of a Regular Line Infantry Regiment. The AKRF thus became the Azad Kashmir Regiment on 20 September 1972. In recent times battalions of the Azad Kashmir Regiment have been stationed all over Pakistan, and have served in places such as Somalia, as part of the United Nations contingent in that country. Presently the regimental center is under the command of Brig. Raja Qadeem Iqbal Khan.",Agent,Organisation,MilitaryUnit,Azad_Kashmir_Regiment,563
"uDraw Pictionary is an art-based video game developed by Page 44 Studios and published by THQ Inc. that players can play on the uDraw GameTablet for the Nintendo Wii. The game is based on the popular board game Pictionary, in which players draw pictures based on clues from a subject and have their teammates guess what specific words the picture is supposed to represent. It was released on November 14, 2010 for the Nintendo Wii game system. Designed as a multi-player game or party game for all ages, players can choose teams of up to four people to play. Since the uDraw GameTablet comes bundled with uDraw Studio, another art-based video game, players can familiarize themselves with how the tablet and stylus pen work before playing, as well as how to draw, color and sketch on the tablet. uDraw Pictionary includes more than 3,000 clues, with traditional Adult Clues like Object, Difficult and Action or Junior Clues like “Animal Houses” and “At the Zoo” for younger players. The game differs somewhat from classic Pictionary, as the video game has new draw modes. The normal Pictionary mode lets users play the game show-style on a 3D game board with a variety of drawing tools, brushes and colors to choose from for a livelier sketching experience. Pictionary Mania has a custom game board and seven new draw modes, including Get It Straight, Shape It Up, Rotation Frustration, One Line, Ink Limit, No Peeking and Off Hand. Free Draw lets players use the drawing tools in the uDraw GameTablet to create works of art. uDraw Pictionary has generally received very positive reviews. When THQ previewed Pictionary at Gamescom2010, reviewers noted that the game's additional mode “does crazy things like limit the amount of ink you have available to draw with, rotates the image while you are drawing or makes you draw without lifting the stylus from the tablet, to name but a few.

"The 1924 United States Presidential Election in Vermont  took place on November 4, 1924 as part of the 1924 United States Presidential Election which was held throughout all contemporary 48 states. Voters chose 4 representatives, or electors to the Electoral College, who voted for President and Vice President. Vermont voted overwhelmingly for the Republican nominee, incumbent President Calvin Coolidge of Massachusetts, over the Democratic nominee, Ambassador John W. Davis of West Virginia. Coolidge ran with former Budget Director Charles G. Dawes of Illinois, while Davis ran with Governor Charles W. Bryan of Nebraska. Also in the running that year was the Progressive Party nominee, Senator Robert M. La Follette of Wisconsin and his running mate Senator Burton K. Wheeler of Montana. Coolidge won in a massive landslide, taking 78.22% of the vote, while Davis took 15.67%, a Republican victory margin of 62.55%. La Follette came in a distant third with 5.79%. Vermont historically was a bastion of liberal Northeastern Republicanism, and by 1924 the Green Mountain State had gone Republican in every presidential election since the founding of the Republican Party. From 1856 to 1920, Vermont had had the longest streak of voting Republican of any state, having never voted Democratic before, and this tradition continued amidst a second consecutive nationwide Republican landslide in 1924. The 1920s were a fiercely Republican decade in American politics, and Vermont in that era was a fiercely Republican state in presidential elections. The economic boom and social good feelings of the Roaring Twenties under popular Republican leadership virtually guaranteed Calvin Coolidge an easy win in the state against the conservative Southern Democrat John Davis, who had little appeal in Northern states like Vermont. Calvin Coolidge also enjoyed a unique personal popularity which helped him in the state. Coolidge was the epitome of a traditional New England Yankee, having been born in the small-town of Plymouth Notch, Vermont, and establishing his political career nearby as Governor of Massachusetts. Thus Coolidge remained especially popular with voters across New England, but especially in his birth state, and Vermont would give him an even more overwhelming victory than it had given to Warren G. Harding in 1920. Even with the strong third party candidacy of Robert La Follette, Coolidge in 1924 managed to gain in both vote share and margin over Harding's landslide showing in the state in 1920. Partly as a consequence of Coolidge's personal popularity in the state, Robert La Follette was not able to attract a large percentage of the vote in Vermont. La Follette had been a Republican Senator prior to mounting his Progressive Party presidential campaign, and in many parts of the country was able to peel off a substantial number of progressive Republican voters. But Vermont Republican voters remained overwhelmingly loyal to Coolidge, and thus while taking 16.61% nationally, La Follette only received 5.79% of the vote in Vermont. Coolidge swept every county in Vermont by landslide margins, taking more than 60% of the vote in all 14 of them. Coolidge broke 70% of the vote in 11 counties and even broke 80% in 7 of those. Notably, Coolidge received more than 70% of the vote even in Chittenden County, the state's most populous county, home to the state's largest city, Burlington. Just four years later, in 1928, Chittenden County flipped to the Democrats and become a Democratic stronghold in the New Deal era, making Coolidge's dominance there in 1924 remarkable. Vermont proved to be the most Republican state in the union in 1924, in terms of both vote share and victory margin. Vermont weighed in as a whopping 37% more Republican than the national average in the 1924 election. No Republican presidential candidate since 1924 has managed to surpass Coolidge's performance in Vermont either in terms of vote share or victory margin.",Event,SocietalEvent,Election,"United_States_presidential_election_in_Vermont,_1924",631

"Rheinallt H Rowlands was a band from Llanfairpwllgwyngyllgogerychwyrndrobwllllantysiliogogogoch operating between 1991 and 2001. It was the brain-child of Ectogram's Alan Holmes and consisted of Oz Wright and Dewi Evans. The band was originally formed to contribute to the spoof compilation album Hen Wlad y Lladd-dai (Land of the Slaughterhouses), an album of songs performed by imaginary singers and groups. Evans and Wright performed under the name Rheinallt H. Rowlands and the following back-story was created: \""On May the 17th 1980, the quarry where Rheinallt H. Rowlands had been working for the previous thirteen years was forced to close, making all the workers redundant. Despondent almost to the point of suicide, Rheinallt walked the thirteen miles back to his isolated cottage for the final time and sat in his old wooden chair with a bowl of broth. Finding the silence unbearable, he turned on his old valve radio and, fumbling to tune it to the Home Service, he inadvertently came across the John Peel programme on BBC Radio 1. Rheinallt would not normally have paused for more than one second on such new-fangled nonsense, but on this occasion the voice that came from the crackly speaker was so deeply mournful it seemed to have a special resonance with his current state of mind. When the record finished, Rheinallt heard that the voice was that of Ian Curtis of the then popular group Joy Division and that he had committed suicide that very day. Far from deepening Rheinallt’s depression, this news brought a profound inspiration to him and he decided that moment that he would forge a new career as a popular singer. The rest, as they say, is history.\"" Upon hearing their contribution to the album, BBC Radio Cymru DJ Nia Melville invited them to record a session for her show Heno Bydd yr Adar yn Canu. Following the success of this recording, Evans and Wright decided to continue performing as Rheinallt H. Rowlands. Their first album, Hendaid Brân a Straeon Eraill (Great-Grandfather Crow and Other Tales), was given a cassette-only release in 1993 on Central Slate records (it was re-released by ankstmusik on CD in 1998). This was followed by Bukowski in 1996, which received significant press attention, drawing comparisons with Scott Walker, Ennio Morricone, and The Divine Comedy. It was named as one of the albums of the year by The Independent. The final Rowlands album, Rheinallt III, was released in 2001 and featured a re-recording of their Welsh-language cover of Joy Division's New Dawn Fades, Gwawr Newydd Yn Cilio. A few months after the release of Rheinallt III, Evans and Wright decided they had taken the band as far as they could and disbanded.

"Déclic Images is a French company specialised in the translation and sale of Japanese-style comics in the French-speaking world. The Déclic Images trademark was born in 1999. As early as 2002, the company produced nearly half of all new Japanese anime published in France. The newly published series are often rich in episodes and their release dates come in quick succession. The main goal of the company is to offer popular series that are accessible to all, containing at least 26 episodes. In order to ensure good sales, Déclic Images decided to produce both recent titles (Love Hina, Fruits Basket, etc.) and anime classics such as Heidi or Masters of the Universe. A commercial war began in 2002 against Kaze animation and Dybex, Déclic Images' competitors in the anime market. This was despite the fact that both of the companies' products were distributed by Déclic Images' parent company, Manga Distribution. In order to guarantee its preeminence in the market, Déclic Images decided to offer Japanese copyright holders unprecedented licence-acquisition offers. Other publishers had the choice between offering equally interesting prices, falling back on less prestigious titles or hoping to find undiscovered talent. At the height of Japanese anime sales in 2005, Déclic Images's sales reached 5.24 million euro. It sold its products in supermarkets, over the Internet and in specialised shops, and in 2004 launched a large marketing campaign that included TV ads. Despite this presence on the market, Déclic Images was in need of a coup, as each product generated only a small profit and Manga Distribution handled its supermarket presence badly. In 2005 everything changed for the young company. After solid growth between 2002 and 2005, with a dozen titles being released per year, the company released Goldorak in August 2005. It was later revealed that Déclic Images did not hold the rights to the title. After extensive judicial travails, a French appeals court confirmed in 2009 a judgment of 4.8 million euro in damages against the company. Several matters remain in the courts, including the matter of a 2006 release of Captain Future without proper licensing rights. Déclic Images has since gone through a number of restructurings and recovery proceedings, and currently seems to be in the impossibility of finding new licensing opportunities, nowadays only relying on re-releases of their current library of titles, having lost the confidence of Japanese distributors and producers, leaving sequels and remakes of anime series that they have licensed (such as Full Metal Panic!: The Second Raid and Last Exile: Fam, the Silver Wing) unlicensed.

"Lithodes santolla, also known as the southern king crab in English or centolla in Peru, Chile and Argentina, is a species of king crab, found off the Pacific coasts of South America, especially from Valdivia at 39° 50' S to Cape Horn at 60° S. It lives in the benthic zone at depths up to 150 metres (490 ft), but south of 40° it has been found at 600 m (2,000 ft). The lucrative centolla fishery around Tierra del Fuego led to an incident in August 1967 when the Argentine schooner Cruz del Sur was found fishing 400 metres (1,300 ft) from Gable Island and had to be escorted out of Chilean waters by the Chilean patrol boat Marinero Fuentealba. This event among many other led to the Beagle conflict in the late 1970s. The United States Food and Drug Administration lists the centolla crab and southern king crab as two separate species: Lithodes antarcticus and Lithodes santolla respectively. Other sources consider Lithodes antarcticus to be a synonym of Lithodes santolla. A recent study has found that L. santolla is capable of withstanding long periods of aerial exposure with not detrimental effect on crab survival, opening the possibility of commercializing L. santolla in the attractive live seafood market.",Species,Animal,Crustacean,Lithodes_santolla,208

"Silver Swallow is a thoroughbred race horse by Alphabet Soup (Cozzene) out of Topsom (Red Ransom) who is known for her coat coloration, a nearly white dappled grey, as well as her repeated second-place finishes in several prominent stakes races in the Southern California racing circuit. Bred by Robert L Dodd and foaled in Florida on April 14, 2004, Silver Swallow was purchased at the Keeneland September 2005 Auction for $55,000. She is currently co-owned by Irwin Molasky and trainer Bruce Headley. Silver Swallow made her debut in a Maiden Special Weight race as a 2-year-old on opening day, December 26, for Santa Anita’s 2006–2007 meet with Alex Solis aboard. She placed third, already displaying the late-closing style that would become typical of many of her subsequent runs. She won a Maiden Special Weight as the favorite on January 14, 2007, but the then 3-year-old filly was disqualified for interference on the stretch and relegated to third place. A little more than a month later, on February 18, Silver Swallow trailed the pack and then rallied to win by two lengths in another Maiden Special Weight. She was entered in the March 11, 2007, 1 1⁄16-mile Grade 1 Santa Anita Oaks, and with odds of 8.00 finished second behind future Belmont Stakes winner Rags to Riches. She was then tested on turf in the April 7, 2007, 1-mile Grade 3 Providencia Stakes with jockey R.A. Dominguez aboard instead of Solis, placing seventh. Silver Swallow returned to the main track with Solis as the favorite for the May 13, 2007, 7f Grade 3 Railbird Stakes on Hollywood Park’s all-weather track and missed first by a nose to Ashley’s Kitty. The 3-year-old was the favorite for the 1 1⁄16 miles Grade 2 Hollywood Breeders' Cup Oaks run on June 10, 2007, but failed to catch Tough Tiz’s Sis and finished second on the all-weather track. Silver Swallow ran on Del Mar’s new Polytrack on July 26, 2007, in an Allowance Optional Claiming stakes as the Morning Line favorite and was again unable to tackle the leader after a late dash, taking home yet another second place. On September 2, 2007, Silver Swallow missed second place by a head in the Torrey Pines Stakes on Del Mar’s Polytrack. She was the favorite and displayed a switch in tactics, running mid-pack for most of the 1-mile distance. She ran as the odds-on favorite in a 1 1⁄16-mile allowance race at Oak Tree's Santa Anita meet on October 4, 2007. Her new strategy of staying more mid pack early on landed her yet another 2nd-place finish. Silver Swallow took off the rest of the 2007 season following this defeat and resumed training in January 2008. Silver Swallow made her 2008 season debut in an Allowance Optional Claiming race at Santa Anita Park on April 18. She was forced wide through much of the early portions of the race and then moved inwards to find the rail, placing third. On Friday May 23, Silver Swallow won an Allowance Optional Claiming by over 2 lengths at Hollywood Park. On July 5, 2008, Silver Swallow, with odds of 23–1, finished third in the Grade 1 Vanity Handicap at Del Mar, finishing 3/4 of a length behind Tough Tiz’s Sis and 1 1⁄4 lengths from the winner Zenyatta. Silver Swallow is scheduled to face up against Tough Tiz’s Sister and the still unbeaten Zenyatta once again for the Grade 2 Clement L. Hirsch Handicap at Del Mar on August 2, 2008.

"Calbovista is a fungal genus containing the single species Calbovista subsculpta, commonly known as the sculptured puffball, sculptured giant puffball, and warted giant puffball. It is a common puffball of the Rocky Mountains and Pacific Coast ranges of western North America. The puffball is more or less round with a diameter of up to 15 cm (6 in), white becoming brownish in age, and covered with shallow pyramid-shaped plates or scales. It fruits singly or in groups along roads and in open woods at high elevations, from summer to autumn. Although the puffball was originally described as new to science by Elizabeth Eaton Morse in 1935, it was not published validly until 60 years later. The species is named for its resemblance to Calvatia sculpta, from which it can be usually distinguished in the field by its less prominent pyramidal warts, and microscopically by the antler-like branches of its capillitium (thread-like material among the spores). Calbovista subsculpta is a good edible species while its interior flesh (the gleba) is still firm and white.

"Mario Cain \""Milo\"" Candini (August 3, 1917 – March 17, 1998) was an American professional baseball pitcher. A 6 ft (1.8 m), 187 lb (85 kg) right-hander, he played all or part of eight seasons in Major League Baseball, between 1943 and 1951, for the Washington Senators (1943–44; 1946–49) and Philadelphia Phillies (1950–51). After his big league career, he continued to pitch in the Pacific Coast League until 1957, primarily for the Sacramento Solons. All told, his pro career lasted twenty seasons. Candini's career began in the New York Yankees' farm system, but he never appeared for the Yanks. Instead, he was traded to Washington in January 1943 and made the Senators' opening day roster. After four standout appearances as a relief pitcher, allowing no runs and five hits in 10 1⁄3 innings pitched, he received his first starting assignment June 2 against the Cleveland Indians. He threw a complete game, 13–1 victory, allowing eight hits. He also went two for five at the plate, to help his own cause. He then won his next four starts, including an 8–0 shutout of the Yankees June 23 in The Bronx. In that game, Candini allowed six hits, all singles, and again helped himself at the plate, going two for two with a home run, a double and two sacrifice bunts. At that point in the season, he had a 7–0 win-loss record (including two wins in relief during May), and a brilliant 0.50 earned run average in 54 1⁄3 innings pitched. He continued to pitch effectively until the end of July, and then came back to the pack with some poor outings mixed in with four more complete games during August and September. His rookie 1943 season, which would be his finest in the Majors, ended with an 11–7 record, a 2.49 earned run average (sixth in the American League), eight complete games and three shutouts. Candini pitched less effectively for Washington in 1944, then served in the United States Army in 1945 in the Pacific Theater of World War II. He did not return to baseball until August 25, 1946. In his return, he hurled four shutout innings of relief against the St. Louis Browns, and received credit for the 12-inning, 5–4 win. His 1947 and 1948 campaigns were less successful, however; he went 5–7 in 73 total games pitched with a composite 5.16 ERA. He then spent most of 1949 in Triple-A, where he won 15 games for the Oakland Oaks, then was selected by the Phillies in the 1949 Rule 5 draft. He got into 18 games, all in relief, for the 1950 Phillies and won his only decision, July 26 against the Chicago Cubs, but his lone win contributed to the \""Whiz Kids\""' narrow triumph in the National League pennant race that season. Candini did not appear in the 1950 World Series, won by the Yankees in four straight games. He again pitched out of the Phillie bullpen in 1951, working in 15 games in his final MLB season. As a major leaguer, he won 26 of 47 decisions, and allowed 530 hits and 250 bases on balls in 537 2⁄3 innings itched, with 183 strikeouts. In 174 games pitched, including 37 starts, he registered 13 complete games, five shutouts and eight saves. As a batter, he hit .243, with 35 hits, six doubles, one home run and eight runs batted in in 144 at bats. In the minor leagues, he won 133 games and his standout career as a relief pitcher was capped by his final season, with the 1957 Sacramento Solons, when he won nine games and compiled a low 1.98 ERA in 57 games pitched.

On most suburban lines, trains depart every five minutes. On Sundays these time intervals are doubled. The first line was opened in 1934, which was Klampenborg-Copenhagen H-Vanløse-Frederiksberg, with more lines soon after. Most were converted from steam operated railways to electric, metro-like operation and stations. Today the network forms the heart of public transport in the city, serving more than 357,000 passengers a day. (Together with the Metro they serve more than 500,000.) The S-train is owned and run by DSB S-tog A/S. Similar to the S-Bahns of Berlin, Vienna and Hamburg, the S-train network covers the entire greater urban area.The system is complemented by the Copenhagen Metro, regional trains, local diesel-powered trains within Metropolitan Copenhagen, an extensive bus network and two lines of shuttle boats called \""harbour buses\"". The different networks use a common system for fare zones and tickets. Copenhagen's two different city rail systems (separated from mainlines), the S-train and the Metro, serve more than half a million people a day, and the city's bus terminals are often adjacent to an S-train or Metro station. As of January 2009 there are 170 km of dual track and 84 S-train stations, of which eight are in neighbouring towns outside greater Copenhagen. At most of the termini other types of train are available for travel to the more remote towns in the metropolitan area (L-tog, diesel-powered local trains) or to the rest of Zealand and the other islands between the Great Belt and Øresund (regionaltog, regional trains). Trains across Øresund to Scania and its main city, Malmö, connect with the S-train network in the city centre. In the city centre, the trains run underground in two tunnel sections. Elsewhere they are in the open, occasionally above or below street level. There is only one underground station, Nørreport, but many stations are elevated above street level (Fuglebakken, Jægersborg, Bernstorffsvej, Nordhavn, Sjælør, Sydhavn, Dyssegård, Jyllingevej, Vanløse and Vigerslev Allé). Flintholm, Ny Ellebjerg and Danshøj stations have tracks crossing each other at different levels with platforms on each level, while at Ryparken they are on the same level. The \""ring line\"" or F line has an elevated section including Nørrebro Station, which offers a view of some of the most populous areas of the city, Nørrebro and Nordvest. Also, the junctions of the Farumbane with the other lines at Ryparken and Svanemøllen include a short elevated section and a short northbound tunnel, respectively. Within the city core (zones 1 & 2) the stations are either elevated or lower than the street level. The S-train system has been entirely one-man operated since 1978. Since 2009 free Wi-Fi Internet access has been available throughout the entire S-train system",Agent,Organisation,PublicTransitSystem,Copenhagen_S-train,604

"The Suomenlinna Church (Finnish: Suomenlinnan kirkko, Swedish: Sveaborgs kyrka) in Finland was built as an Eastern Orthodox garrison church for the Russian troops of Suomenlinna sea fortress in 1854, and originally had five onion domes. The church was designed by Konstantin Thon, an official architect of Imperial Russia during the reign of czar Nicholas I, and whose major works include the Cathedral of Christ the Saviour, the Grand Kremlin Palace, and the Kremlin Armoury in Moscow. The fortress comprises five islands joined together by bridges, and the church is the central feature on the island of Iso Mustasaari surrounded on all sides by fortification works. Before the design and construction of the Orthodox church plans were drawn up in the 1820s by architect Carl Ludwig Engel for a church on the same site, but designed in the neoclassical style, in keeping with the rest of buildings in the fortress and the buildings of the capital, Helsinki. The Orthodox church was converted into an Evangelical Lutheran church during the 1920s. Its extensive iconography was warehoused by the city of Helsinki, but their current whereabouts are unknown. Today its central dome doubles as a lighthouse making it one of only a few churches in the world that double as a lighthouse. The signal blink is the Morse code for the letter \""H\"" for Helsinki.

Whereas the main story of Mobile Suit Gundam SEED focuses on the struggles between the Earth Alliance, ZAFT, and Orb Union, the Astray series is focused on the three MBF-P0x mobile suit prototypes (however mainly on Lowe Guele) and their respective pilots and organizations, who mainly exist on the outskirts of the main SEED storyline. The MBF-P02 Astray Red Frame is piloted by Lowe Guele of the Junk Guild, and the MBF-P03 Astray Blue Frame is piloted by Gai Murakumo of the mercenary group Serpent Tail. The third Astray, MBF-P01 Astray Gold Frame, is piloted by the primary antagonist of the Astray story, Orb nobleman Rondo Ghina Sahaku, and later by his twin sister Rondo Mina Sahaku.

"Peltigera aphthosa is a species of lichen known by the common names green dog lichen, leafy lichen, felt lichen, and common freckle pelt. It has a circumpolar distribution, occurring throughout the Arctic, boreal, and temperate regions of the Northern Hemisphere. This lichen has a large thallus which may exceed one meter in width. It is divided into lobes up to about 10 centimeters long and 6 wide. It is green, becoming pale as it dries. The thallus is dotted with cephalodia, which contains one of the two symbionts, a species of Nostoc. The other is a species of Coccomyxa.

"Abraham \""Abe\"" Gibron (September 22, 1925 – September 23, 1997) was a professional American football player and coach. Gibron played 11 seasons as a guard in the All-America Football Conference (AAFC) and National Football League (NFL) in the 1940s and 1950s, mostly with the Cleveland Browns. He was then hired as an assistant coach for the NFL's Washington Redskins and Chicago Bears before becoming head coach of the Bears between 1972 and 1974. Gibron grew up in Indiana, where he was a standout athlete in high school. After graduating, he spent two years in the U.S. military during World War II, enrolling at Valparaiso University upon his discharge. He later transferred to Purdue University, where he played football for two years and was named an All-Big Ten Conference guard. Gibron's professional career began in 1949 with the Buffalo Bills of the AAFC. The league dissolved after that season, however, and he moved to the Browns in the NFL. While he was initially a substitute, Gibron developed into a strong lineman on Cleveland teams that won NFL championships in 1950, 1954 and 1955 behind an offensive attack that featured quarterback Otto Graham, end Dante Lavelli and tackle Lou Groza. He was named to the Pro Bowl, the NFL's all-star game, each year between 1952 and 1955. After short stints with the Philadelphia Eagles and the Bears, Gibron ended his playing career and got into coaching. He served first as a line coach for the Redskins for five years, and then in a similar role for the Bears beginning in 1965. He rose to become Bears' defensive coordinator in the early 1970s, and was named head coach in 1972, replacing Jim Dooley. Gibron's three years leading the Bears were unsuccessful, however. His teams posted a combined win–loss–tie record of 11–30–1 over three seasons. Gibron was fired in 1974, and spent the following year as coach of the Chicago Winds, a team in the short-lived World Football League. Gibron, who was known for his colorful personality and large size – he ballooned to more than 300 pounds as a coach – spent seven seasons as an assistant with the Tampa Bay Buccaneers before retiring from coaching. He stayed close to the game, however, by serving as a scout for the Seattle Seahawks in the late 1980s and as an advisor to the Buccaneers in the early 1990s.

"2500 Alascattalo, provisional designation 1926 GC, is a stony Flora asteroid from the inner regions of the asteroid belt, about 8 kilometers in diameter. It was discovered by German astronomer Karl Reinmuth at the Heidelberg Observatory in southern Germany, on 2 April 1926. The S-type asteroid is a member of the Flora family, one of the largest groups of stony asteroids in the main-belt. It orbits the Sun at a distance of 2.0–2.5 AU once every 3 years and 4 months (1,225 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.10 and an inclination of 7° with respect to the ecliptic. No precoveries were obtained prior to its discovery. A rotational light-curve of this asteroid was obtained from photometric observations made by Junda Liu at the Lvye Observatory (P34), China, and at the iTelescope Observatory (Q62), at the Siding Spring Observatory site, Australia, in December 2015. The light-curve gave a well-defined rotation period of 2.751±0.002 hours with a brightness variation of 0.19 in magnitude (U=3-). A previous light-curve with a concurring period of 2.754±0.007 hours and a similar amplitude of 0.15 was already obtained by French amateur astronomer Pierre Antonini in March 2013 (U=2). According to the survey carried out by the NEOWISE mission of NASA's space-based Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer, the asteroid measures 7.9 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo of 0.21, while the Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link assumes an albedo of 0.24 – which derives from 8 Flora, the largest member and namesake of this orbital family – and calculates a diameter of 8.2 kilometers, based on an absolute magnitude of 12.6. The minor planet was named after the mythological creature \""Alascattalo\"", a fictional chimera between a moose and a walrus. According to legend, it was genetically bred by miners during the Klondike Gold Rush in the late 19th century. The alascattalo also stands for the local people's unique sense of humor, dealing with tourists who ask naive questions, and is the mascot of the four-minute long, annual parade on \""Alascattalo Day\"" held in November.

"Anywhere Festival is an annual Brisbane based festival for performance anywhere but traditional theatre spaces. The first anywhere-but-in-a-traditional-theatre concept was brought to Brisbane in 2011 by creative director Paul Osuch and his partner, Ally McTavish. Their theory is that we need to take traditional story-telling out of theatre buildings and back to where life really takes place, in the community. The festival – which holds performances anywhere but in a traditional theatre – began in 2011 with 4000 attendees and 31 productions. Since it began, the Anywhere Festival (they dropped the \""Theatre\"" in 2015) has grown in size and popularity as it inhabited the nooks and crannies of this city of ours The idea behind Anywhere is that the art of theatre should not be constrained by, well, a theatre nor by a time frame of two plus hours with interval, or even a genre. The idea behind Anywhere Festival is that you don't - you shouldn't - have to go to a traditional theatre space to see theatre. You shouldn't have to pay a lot of money for tickets, and artists shouldn't be limited by space or cost or time. For 10 days this month, you can see exciting theatre in parks, backyards, bedrooms, lifts, trains and even on Twitter, not just in Brisbane but as far away as Toowoomba to the west, and Yandina to the north. \""The festival is about theatre anywhere but in a theatre,\"" explains Paul Osuch, the mastermind behind the festival. He started Anywhere with his wife, Alex McTavish. \""I could see people wanted exciting theatre that didn't have to happen in a theatre,\"" he says. \""What kicked it over the line was when English actor Ian McKellen couldn't find a theatre space in Brisbane to bring his acclaimed Waiting for Godot. I figured that if he had trouble getting into a Brisbane theatre there were probably a lot of less-well-known theatre producers with the same problem.\"" It wasn't just a lack of available theatre venues that prompted him to act. Osuch says he found many traditional theatre spaces were restrictive, both for audiences and artists, and smothered in an air of \""elitism\"" that was turning people away. \""I find that most performances in a theatre space are just a little sterile. And parking's difficult, the drinks are generally overpriced and, as someone over the height of six foot, I'm not a big fan of theatre seating where I have to watch a show through the gap in my knees,\"" he says. \""I feel that the traditional theatre spaces stop more people going to experience it than it regularly attracts. It's been turned into this big thing with a huge infrastructure around it instead of it being something that people feel they can pop along to in their own neighbourhood or do themselves.\"" \""Ultimately, the Anywhere Festival is about entertainment and theatre but it is also about encouraging businesses to engage with their community in a new way\"", says co-founder and creative producer, Alex McTavish.\"" \""It may seem like it is a simple arts festival but community and communion is what it's all about,\"" she says.

"The Doolittle Raid, also known as the Tokyo Raid, on Saturday, April 18, 1942, was an air raid by the United States of America on the Japanese capital Tokyo and other places on the island of Honshu during World War II, the first air strike to strike the Japanese Home Islands. It demonstrated that Japan itself was vulnerable to American air attack, served as retaliation for the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor on Sunday, December 7, 1941, and provided an important boost to American morale. The raid was planned and led by Lieutenant Colonel James \""Jimmy\"" Doolittle of the United States Army Air Forces. Sixteen B-25B Mitchell medium bombers were launched without fighter escort from the U.S. Navy's aircraft carrier USS Hornet deep in the Western Pacific Ocean, each with a crew of five men. The plan called for them to bomb military targets in Japan, and to continue westward to land in China—landing a medium bomber on Hornet was impossible. Fifteen aircraft reached China, but all crashed, while the 16th landed at Vladivostok in the Soviet Union. All but three of the 80 crew members initially survived the mission. Eight airmen were captured by the Japanese Army in China; three of those were later executed. The B-25 that landed in the Soviet Union was confiscated and its crew interned for more than a year. Fourteen complete crews, except for one crewman who was killed in action, returned either to the United States or to American forces. After the raid, the Japanese Imperial Army conducted a massive sweep through the eastern coastal provinces of China, in an operation now known as the Zhejiang-Jiangxi Campaign, searching for the surviving American airmen and inflicting retribution on the Chinese who aided them, in an effort to prevent this part of China from being used again for an attack on Japan. The raid caused negligible material damage to Japan, but it achieved its goal of raising American morale and casting doubt in Japan on the ability of its military leaders to defend their home islands. It also contributed to Admiral Isoroku Yamamoto's decision to attack Midway Island in the Central Pacific—an attack that turned into a decisive strategic defeat of the Imperial Japanese Navy (IJN) by the U.S. Navy in the Battle of Midway.

"4263 Abashiri, provisional designation 1989 RL2, is a stony Flora asteroid from the inner regions of the asteroid belt, about 8 kilometers in diameter. It was discovered on 7 September 1989, by Japanese astronomers Masayuki Yanai and Kazuro Watanabe at Kitami Observatory in eastern Hokkaidō, Japan. The S-type asteroid is a member of the Flora family, one of the largest groups of stony asteroids in the main-belt. It orbits the Sun at a distance of 1.9–2.5 AU once every 3 years and 4 months (1,220 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.14 and an inclination of 6° with respect to the ecliptic. Due to a precovery obtained at Palomar Observatory in 1951, the asteroid's observation arc could be extended by 38 years prior to its discovery. In 2008 and 2011, two rotational light-curves obtained by Czech astronomer Petr Pravec gave a well-defined rotation period of 4.8820±0.0002 and 4.8817±0.0001 hours with a corresponding brightness variation of 0.15 and 0.11 in magnitude, respectively (U=3/3). According to the survey carried out by NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer with its subsequent NEOWISE mission, the asteroid measures 9.0 kilometers in diameter and its surface has an albedo of 0.20, while the Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link assumes an albedo of 0.24, derived from the Flora family's largest member and namesake, the asteroid 8 Flora, and calculates a somewhat smaller diameter of 7.2 kilometers. The minor planet was named for the Japanese city of Abashiri, known for its fishing industry. It is located at the Sea of Okhotsk, about 50 kilometers east of Kitami, in the eastern part of the island of Hokkaidō.

"Paseo de la Reforma is a wide avenue that runs diagonally across the heart of Mexico City. It was designed by Ferdinand von Rosenzweig in the 1860s and modeled after the great boulevards of Europe, such as the Ringstrasse in Vienna and the Champs-Élysées in Paris. After the French intervention in Mexico overthrew the constitutional President Benito Juárez, the newly crowned Emperor Maximilian made his mark on the conquered city. He commissioned a grand avenue linking the city center with his imperial residence, Chapultepec Castle, which was then on the southwestern edge of town. The project was originally named Paseo de la Emperatriz (\""Promenade of the Empress\"") in honor of Maximilian's consort and second cousin Empress Carlota. After her return to Europe and Maximilian's subsequent execution, the restored Juárez government renamed the Paseo in honor of the Reform War. It is now home to many of Mexico's tallest buildings such as the Torre Mayor and others in the Zona Rosa. More modern extensions continue the avenue at an angle to the old Paseo. To the northeast it continues toward Tlatelolco, where it changes its name near the Plaza de las Tres Culturas. There it divides into Calzada de Guadalupe and Calzada de los Misterios that continue toward La Villa.

A total number of 62 athletes completed the race, with Maurice Charlotin from Haiti finishing in 62nd and last position in 3:29:21. There were 74 competitors from 39 countries. Twelve of them did not finish. The marathon route in the 1972 Olympics was created to resemble the mascot, Waldi. The course was arranged so that the head of the dog faced west, with athletes running counter-clockwise, starting at the back of the dog's neck and continuing around the ears. The mouth of the dog was represented by the path through the Nymphenburg Park, and its front feet were represented by the run though the Hirschgarten.

"Aspicilia phaea (dusky sunken disk lichen) is a grayish brown to tan areolate crustose lichen commonly found on rock in coastal to inland parts of central and southern California. Described as new to science in 2007, it is endemic to (only found in) California. It grows on exposed or partially shaded siliceous rock, with a few known occurrences on serpentine rock. In rare cases full areolas do not form, and it appears as being cracked (rimose). There are often grayish or whitish spots on the areolas. The thallus is 2–8 cm in diameter, and 0.1– 1.2 mm thick. The areolas are irregularly sized and angular, giving the lichen body (thallus) the appearance of a mosaic of small polygons. A rim of dark tissue (prothallus) may surround the edges of the lichen. The fruiting body parts (apothecia) are flat to concave (especially in the thallus center), and slightly immersed in the thallus, appearing as sunken round to polygonal discs, often with a grey or white rim of thalline tissue.

"Spencer Perceval, KC (1 November 1762 – 11 May 1812) was the Prime Minister of the United Kingdom from 4 October 1809 until his death on 11 May 1812. He is the only British prime minister to have been assassinated. He is also the only solicitor general or attorney general to have been prime minister, and the only prime minister whose entire lifetime was spent in the reign of the sovereign under which he held office, George III (who had become king in 1760 and survived Perceval to 1820). The younger son of an Irish earl, Perceval was educated at Harrow School and Trinity College, Cambridge. He studied law at Lincoln’s Inn, practised as a barrister on the Midland circuit and in 1796 became a King’s Counsel before entering politics at the age of 33 as a Member of Parliament for Northampton. A follower of William Pitt, Perceval always described himself as a \""friend of Mr Pitt\"" rather than a Tory. Perceval was opposed to Catholic emancipation and reform of Parliament; he supported the war against Napoleon and the abolition of the slave trade. He was opposed to hunting, gambling and adultery, did not drink as much as most Members of Parliament, gave generously to charity, and enjoyed spending time with his twelve children. After a late entry into politics, his rise to power was rapid; he was solicitor and then attorney general in the Addington Ministry, Chancellor of the Exchequer and Leader of the House of Commons in the Portland Ministry, and became prime minister in October 1809. At the head of a weak ministry, Perceval faced a number of crises during his term in office including an inquiry into the Walcheren expedition, the madness of King George III, economic depression and Luddite riots.

"Saint Gregory of Utrecht (born c. 700/705 – died 770s) was born of a noble family at Trier. His father Alberic was the son of Addula, who in her widowhood was Abbess of Pfalzel (Palatiolum) near Trier. (Because of the similarity of names and also because of a forged will, Addula has been frequently confused with Saint Adela of Pfalzel, daughter of Dagobert II of Austrasia, thus wrongly imputing to Gregory membership of the royal house of the Merovingians). He received his early education at Pfalzel. When, in 722, Saint Boniface passed through Trier on his way from Frisia to Hesse and Thuringia, he stayed at this convent. Gregory was called upon to read the scriptures at the meals. Saint Boniface gave an explanation of them and expanded upon the merits of an apostolic life, by which Gregory was inspired to accompany him. He now became the disciple and later the helper of the Apostle of Germany, accompanying him in all his missionary tours. In 738 Saint Boniface made his third journey to Rome; Gregory went with him and brought back many valuable additions for his library. About 750 Gregory was made Abbot of St. Martin's, in Utrecht. In 744 Saint Willibrord, the first Bishop of Utrecht, had died but had received no successor. Saint Boniface had taken charge and had appointed an administrator, Saint Eoban. In 754 he started on his last missionary trip accompanied by Eoban, who was to share his martyrdom. After this, Pope Stephen II and Pippin the Younger ordered Gregory to look after the diocese. For this reason he is sometimes called bishop, though he never received episcopal consecration. The school of his abbey, the Martinsstift, a kind of missionary seminary, was now a centre of learning for many nations: Franks, Frisians, Saxons, even Bavarians and Swabians. England too, though it had splendid schools of its own, sent scholars. Among his disciples, Saint Ludger is perhaps the best known, later to be the first Bishop of Münster and author of the Life of Gregory, in which he describes his virtues, his contempt of riches, his sobriety, his forgiving spirit and his deeds of alms [1].

"5357 Sekiguchi, provisional designation 1992 EL, is an asteroid from the outer region of the asteroid belt, approximately 15 kilometers in diameter. It was discovered on 2 March 1992, by Japanese amateur astronomers Tetsuya Fujii and Kazuro Watanabe at the Kitami Observatory in eastern Hokkaidō, Japan. The asteroid orbits the Sun at a distance of 2.7–3.3 AU once every 5 years and 2 months (1,887 days). Its orbit has an eccentricity of 0.10 and an inclination of 9° with respect to the plane of the ecliptic. The first precovery was obtained at Goethe Link Observatory in 1950, extending the asteroid's observation arc by 42 years prior to its discovery. A rotational light-curve of this asteroid was obtained by French astronomers René Roy and Laurent Bernasconi from photometric observations made in October 2005. It showed a rotation period of 5.41±0.01 hours with a brightness variation of 0.72 in magnitude (U=3). In October 2010 and November 2011, two more light-curves were obtained at the U.S. Palomar Transient Factory, rendering a period of 5.4048 and 5.4100 hours with an amplitude of 0.58 and 0.27 in magnitude, respectively (U=2/2). According to the surveys carried out by the Japanese Akari satellite and NASA's Wide-field Infrared Survey Explorer with its NEOWISE mission, the asteroid measures between 14.3 and 15.2 kilometers in diameter. However, the Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link (CALL) calculates a much larger diameter of 25.4 kilometers. This is due to strongly divergent albedos, as the lower the reflectivity (albedo), the larger a body's diameter. While CALL assumes the body's surface to be of a carbonaceous composition, and classifies it as a dark C-type asteroid with a correspondingly low albedo of 0.057, the space-based surveys find higher albedos of 0.19, 0.33 and 0.38, respectively. The minor planet was named in honor of Japanese astronomer Tomohiko Sekiguchi (b. 1970), associate professor at Hokkaido University. From 1998 to 2001, he had been observing minor planets at the European Southern Observatory.

"10502 Armaghobs, provisional designation 1987 QF6, is an eccentric, rare-type stony asteroid and Mars-crosser from the inner regions of the asteroid belt, about 3 kilometers in diameter. It was discovered by American female astronomer Eleanor Helin at the U.S. Palomar Observatory in California, on 22 August 1987. The S-type asteroid was also classified as a relatively rare Q-type body by Pan-STARRS' large-scale survey. It orbits the Sun at a distance of 1.6–3.0 AU once every 3 years and 6 months (1,282 days). Its orbit is tilted by 22 degrees to the plane of the ecliptic and shows a notable eccentricity of 0.32. The first precovery was taken at ESO's La Silla site in 1980, extending the asteroid's observation arc by 7 years prior to its discovery. In 2013, a rotational light-curve obtained from photometric observations at the Riverland Dingo Observatory at Moorook, South Australia, gave a rotation period of 24.978±0.002 hours with a brightness amplitude of 0.51 in magnitude (U=2). The Collaborative Asteroid Lightcurve Link assumes a standard albedo for stony asteroids of 0.20, and calculates a diameter of 3.0 kilometers based on an absolute magnitude of 15.0. The minor planet was named after the Armagh Observatory in Northern Ireland. The present-day astronomical research institute was founded by Archbishop Richard Robinson in 1790. The Estonian astronomer Ernst Öpik, after whom 2099 Öpik is named, had been a long-time member of the Observatory.

"It is an intense one-act play, which was one of the pieces mentioned in a list of Maeterlinck’s most characteristic plays. This list was highlighted in the speech given to honour Maeterlinck with the Nobel Prize in 1911. The play was originally written in French later to be translated into several different languages, such as English and German. The piece is not only a study of human condition in general but it appears to confront its reader with the effect of hope on the latter. Unlike most other theatrical pieces The Blind does not introduce its readers to readily shaped characters, but twelve de-personalised beings. These beings were not provided with names but titles describing their general condition, for instance the eldest blind man. This method of writing gives an audience, or theatre professional an opportunity to read between the lines and interpret the piece according to personal desire. Maeterlinck has since been considered as the founder of a new type of dramatic writing, Symbolism. Parallels have often been drawn with Samuel Beckett’s Waiting for Godot, which was produced in the mid 20th century and appears to construct a similar world of waiting and hoping, which is evident in The Blind.",Work,WrittenWork,Play,The_Blind,201

At the time of Partition in 1947, the princely states of India, who in principle had self-government within their own territories, were subject to subsidiary alliances with the British, giving them control of their external relations. In the Indian Independence Act 1947 the British abandoned all such alliances, leaving the states with the option of opting for full independence. However, by 1948 almost all had acceded to either India or Pakistan. One major exception was that of the wealthiest and most powerful principality, Hyderabad, where the Nizam, Osman Ali Khan, Asif Jah VII, a Muslim ruler who presided over a largely Hindu population, chose independence and hoped to maintain this with an irregular army recruited from the Muslim aristocracy, known as the Razakars. The Nizam was also beset by the Telangana uprising, which he was unable to subjugate. The Indian government, anxious to avoid what it termed a Balkanization of what had been the Indian Empire, was determined to effect the integration of Hyderabad into the new Indian Union.

"\""Are You Ready for Love\"" is a song recorded by Elton John in 1977, and was first released in the UK in 1979 on the EP The Thom Bell Sessions. It was written by Leroy Bell, Thom Bell and Casey James, and was originally produced in Philadelphia by Thom Bell (who had already produced a series of hits for The Spinners, The Delfonics and The Stylistics). While the song, \""Mama Can't Buy You Love\"" from the EP charted in 1979, this song and the other track on the three-track 12-inch vinyl disc, \""Three Way Love Affair\"", were only minor footnotes at the time. In 1989, MCA released a 6-track CD, The Complete Thom Bell Sessions, which contained a different mix of \""Are You Ready for Love\"" in place of the one that appeared on the original 1979 EP. (The original \""Thom Bell Sessions\"" EP mix did, however, surface — along with the EP's other two original tracks — as a b-side to a UK CD-single of \""The Last Song\"" in 1992, issued as Rocket/Phonogram EJSCB-30). In 2003, it was remixed by Ashley Beedle and released as a 12\"" vinyl single on 25 August 2003.

"Mount Spurr is a stratovolcano in the Aleutian Arc of Alaska, named after United States Geological Survey geologist and explorer Josiah Edward Spurr, who led an expedition to the area in 1898. The Alaska Volcano Observatory (AVO) currently rates Mount Spurr as Level of Concern Color Code Green. The mountain is known aboriginally by the Dena'ina Athabascan name K'idazq'eni, literally 'that which is burning inside'. Mount Spurr, the highest volcano of the Aleutian arc, is a large lava dome constructed at the center of a roughly 5 km-wide horseshoe-shaped caldera that is open to the south. The volcano lies 130 km west of Anchorage and NE of Chakachamna Lake. The caldera was formed by a late-Pleistocene or early Holocene debris avalanche and associated pyroclastic flows that destroyed an ancestral Spurr volcano. The debris avalanche traveled more than 25 km to the SE, and the resulting deposit contains blocks as large as 100m in diameter. Several ice-carved post-caldera domes lie in the caldera. Present Mt. Spurr is the highest of the post-caldera. This regrown summit peak of Spurr experienced a heating event in 2004 which created a small crater lake. By 2008, the summit crater had cooled enough to have begun to have accumulated significant amounts of snow again. The youngest post-caldera dome, Crater Peak (2309m, 7575 ft), formed at the breached southern end of the caldera about 3.2 km south of Spurr, has been the source of about 40 identified Holocene tephra layers. Spurr's two historical eruptions, from Crater Peak in 1953 and 1992, deposited ash on the city of Anchorage. Crater Peak has a summit crater that is itself slightly breached along the south rim; the north wall of the crater exposes the truncated remains of an older dome or lava lake. Before the 1992 eruption, a small crater lake occupied the bottom of Crater Peak's crater. As with other Alaskan volcanoes, the proximity of Spurr to major trans-Pacific aviation routes means that an eruption of this volcano can significantly disrupt air travel. Volcanic ash can cause jet engines to fail.",Place,NaturalPlace,Volcano,Mount_Spurr,342

He served as a minister in the government of Albert Hawke. Kelly was born in Perth to Margaret Ann (née Campbell) and John Kelly. He attended Christian Brothers' College, Perth, and after leaving school went to the Gascoyne, managing a station near Gascoyne Junction. He served on the Upper Gascoyne Road Board from 1927 to 1928. Kelly later moved to Bullfinch, a small town in the eastern Wheatbelt, where he ran a store. He was elected to the Yilgarn Road Board in 1929, and would serve until 1943. Kelly first stood for parliament at the 1939 state election, as an \""independent Labor\"" candidate, but was defeated in the seat of Yilgarn-Coolgardie by the endorsed Labor candidate, George Lambert. Lambert died in office in June 1941, and Kelly won the resulting by-election as an \""independent Country\"" candidate. At the 1943 state election, Kelly was re-elected to Yilgarn-Coolgardie as a plain independent. However, he joined the Labor Party in July 1946, and was re-elected unopposed as a Labor candidate at the 1947 state election. At the 1950 election, Kelly's seat was abolished, and he transferred to the new seat of Merredin-Yilgarn. After Labor's victory at the 1953 election, he was made Minister for Mines and Minister for Fisheries in the new ministry formed by Albert Hawke. He was also made Minister for Industrial Development in 1954. In a reshuffle in December 1957, he lost the mines and industrial development portfolios, but was made Minister for Lands and Minister for Agriculture. The Labor government was defeated at the 1959 state election. Kelly remained in parliament until his retirement at the 1968 election. Merredin-Yilgarn had become increasingly marginal, and the replacement Labor candidate, James Brown, was defeated by the Liberal Party's Jack Stewart (although Labor reclaimed the seat three years later).

"Lake Rosalind is a small inland lake located in Bruce County, Ontario, Canada between the towns of Hanover and Walkerton. Lake Rosalind and the interconnected Marl Lake to its south are manmade lakes that were created by the excavation of marl for local cement plants in the early 1900s and the construction of dams later in 1939 and 1946. Both lakes are relatively shallow and small in area (38 hectares and 14 hectares, respectively). Marl Lake receives Lake Rosalind's overflow through a culvert, and there is also an interconnected \""North Lake\"" to the north of Lake Rosalind. Almost the entire lakefront is developed, with mostly small properties that have been \""urbanized\"" with hardened shorelines and manicured lawns. The high level of development resulted from the proximity of Hanover and Walkerton and excellent road system in the area. The major source of water for the lake is from groundwater aquifers; there are no major streams or creeks that flow into the lake. There is minimal surface runoff from surrounding land, which is used for agricultural purposes. Lake Rosalind is considered a headwater lake and provides water for the Saugeen River. Little forest cover remains around the lake. In the fall of 2006, Lake Rosalind was infested with blue-green algae, which put a sudden halt to all water-related activities. Over the winter the algae died off, but residents are urged to not use lawn fertilizers and to keep their shoreline natural.",Place,BodyOfWater,Lake,Lake_Rosalind_(Ontario),239
"Ireby Fell Cavern is a cave system on Ireby Fell, Lancashire, England, near the border with North Yorkshire.It is a segment of the Three Counties System, linking the Rift Pot system to the south with Notts Pot to the north. This popular cave starts with a pitch series that eventually opens out into a very large series of dry sandy passages. The entrance is a vertical concrete pipe at the bottom of a shakehole that was last shored up in 2006. The traditional route is down three pitches (Ding, Dong, and Bell), but there is an alternative Shadow route which escapes most of the water flow in wet weather. After many metres of rift passage is Well Pitch which accesses the main lower sandy passages known as Duke Street. At the far end of Duke Street is Whirlpool chamber where a short sump (not free-diveable) gave access to cave divers into further passages known as Ireby II. In early 2007, a system involving a primitive hand pump and a mud dam to temporarily retain the water in an artificial lake in Duke Street allowed non-divers to enter this part of the cave. This facilitated the digging out of a passage in the roof of Whirlpool Chamber previously blocked by sand, to be dug out from both ends hence creating a bypass to the sump. Digging has also forged a dry bypass to the sump via the aptly named Cripple Creek.",Place,NaturalPlace,Cave,Ireby_Fell_Cavern,240

"The great spotted kiwi, great gray kiwi, or roroa (Apteryx haastii) is a species of kiwi endemic to the South Island of New Zealand. The great spotted kiwi, as a member of the ratites, is flightless. It is the largest of the kiwi. The rugged topography and harsh climate of the high altitude, alpine, part of its habitat render it inhospitable to a number of introduced mammalian predators, which include dogs, ferrets, cats and stoats. Because of this, populations of this species have been less seriously affected by the predations of these invasive species compared to other kiwi. Nonetheless, there has been a 43% decline in population in the past 45 years, due to these predators and habitat destruction. This has led it to be classified as vulnerable. There are less than 16,000 great spotted kiwis in total, almost all in the more mountainous parts of northwest Nelson, the northwest coast, and the Southern Alps. A minority live on island reserves. This kiwi is highly aggressive, and pairs will defend their large territories (49 acres) against other kiwi. Great spotted kiwi are nocturnal, and will sleep during the day in burrows. At night, they feed on invertebrates and will also eat plants. Great spotted kiwi breed between June and March. The egg is the largest of all birds in proportion to the size of the bird. Chicks take 75 to 85 days to hatch, and after hatching, they are abandoned by their parents.",Species,Animal,Bird,Great_spotted_kiwi,243
